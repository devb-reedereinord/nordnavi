This procedure provides guidance on how to prepare and present shipboard accounts.

###### Preparing Shipboard Accounts Procedure

The master shall:

Prepare and verify the accuracy of shipboard accounts.

Maintain accounts in Payroll Software as per detailed instructions available on board.

Prepare accounts in U.S. dollars and Euro, as applicable.

Show money received and spent in the account.

Shipboard accounting covers:

Payroll and individual wage accounts of crew

Master's cash account

Charterer's representation

Owner's representation

Final wages account

Travel expenses

Allotments

Cash advances to crew

Special payments

Cash to master

###### Payroll

The master shall:

Complete payroll at the end of each month for crewmembers who served on board for either a full month or part thereof.

Note: A month is taken as 30 days.

Prepare separate USD and EUR payrolls.

Enter the seafarer’s reimbursement of travel expenses and other compensations due as earnings.

The software calculates:

Contractual wages

Balance from the previous month

The personnel department enters the seniority (year scale) in the contract crew card.

Deductions from total earnings include:

Cash advances taken

Home allotments

Purchase from bond

Private communication expenses

Clothing purchases

Other charges for the crewmember’s account

Calculate the accumulated leave ashore payable at the end of the contract separately from wages and other earnings.

The individual account of wages for each crew member is prepared automatically.

Provide a copy to crew once the payroll is completed.

Complete the payroll for the preceding month by the beginning of the following month and inform the personnel department by e-mail.

Send the following to the personnel department as scanned copies by e-mail with monthly returns:

Cash accounts

Receipts for technical items purchased in cash, such as:

Provisions

Stores

Other items

Vessel form ADM 25 – List of owners and charterers representation

Statement of deduction of internet charges for crew

Report for crew telephone/internet cards stock

Statement of deduction for company clothing for crew

Statements of cash advance to crew

Statement of canteen deduction for crew

Sports fund account

The overtime summary for the month (ADM 05)

File the original pay slips, signed by the crew, including attachments bearing the crewmember’s signatures, on board the vessel in the master’s file for shipboard accounts. Keep the records on board for seven years.

Note: Upon request of crewing management, send the original wage accounts bearing the crewmember’s signatures to the office with monthly returns.

###### Master’s Cash Account

The master’s cash account (form ACCT -01) contains a record of cash transactions on board.

Complete this at the end of each month.

Maintain cash accounts for USD and EURO.

Support each entry in the cash account with an original invoice, receipt, or voucher for cash received or disbursed.

Enter currencies other than USD or EURO held on board in the USD cash accounts.

The final balances shown in the cash accounts at the end of the month should correspond to the actual physical cash in hand.

Carry forward these balances as the opening balances for the following month’s cash accounts.

Note: Unless for practical reasons, cash purchases of provisions, stores, etc., should be paid and reported in USD in the cash account.

Maintain the following in USD:

Provision account

Sport fund (show contributions in USD cash account)

Note: In exceptional circumstances, if crews who receive their wages in USD need to take a cash advance in Euro or vice versa, the master may arrange this. This should not be routine.

If cash advance is issued in Euro to the crew paid in USD, deduct this from the EUR cash account as a separate item, clearly showing the applicable amount in USD, which would be deducted from the crewmember’s USD wages.

Apply the same procedure if the crew receiving their wages in EUR need cash in USD.

During a change of command:

Both masters shall sign the ‘master’s handover form’ verifying the cash handed over.

The relieved master should complete the cash accounts up to the date of handing over command.

Enter the amounts of cash handed over to the relieving master in the cash accounts twice:

###### Charterer’s and Owner’s Representation

Use form ADM 25 for recording the charterer’s and owner’s representation.

When a master dispenses items from the vessel’s bond for entertainment on behalf of the charterer, try to recover the expenses directly from the charterer. If not possible, recover through the master’s cash account or payroll.

Prepare the charterer’s representation separately for each port.

Recover the owner’s representation costs through the master’s cash account or payroll.

Send copies of the charterer’s and owner’s representation accounts to the respective personnel & operations departments by e-mail together with the monthly payroll.

###### Final Wages Account

When a crewmember leaves a vessel:

Hand over a final account of wages to them.

Select the correct bank details in Payroll Software for wage balance transfer.

Inform the personnel officer of the seafarer’s next availability date by e-mail.

Most crewmembers under the IBF-ITF-REEDEREI NORD Collective Bargaining Agreement receive half of the leave pay monthly on board, with the other half payable at the end of the contract.

Filipino, and Indian ratings receive the entire leave pay for the contract period at the end.

Off-signing crewmembers may receive their leave pay from the office in cash on board.

However, retain USD 200 for crew paid in USD, or EUR 130 for crew paid in Euro, and show as ‘Balance to be paid from office’. This balance will be paid to the crewmember’s account after the FWA has been checked by the personnel department.

Payment of this balance will be arranged promptly within a month after the crewmember’s disembarkation.

Caution: Crewmembers must be aware of customs restrictions about carrying large amounts of cash and/or other risks during traveling.

Pay cadets of all nationalities their entire balance of wages on board when they sign off, unless the personnel department issues specific instructions.

Send the FWA to the personnel department by e-mail as soon as possible after the crewmember disembarks, as no settlement will be made before the FWA is received in the office.

Prepare and send the FWA to the personnel department by e-mail for checking prior to disembarkation of the off-signing crewmember.

Once FWA is checked by the Personnel Officer and confirmation is received, the off signer can be paid off.

The off-signing seafarer should sign the FWA, acknowledging the sum paid on board in cash.

The seafarer’s signature also acknowledges the amount of balance payable to his bank account and correctness of bank details entered in the FWA.

Prepare the FWA in duplicate.

Hand over the original FWA to the seafarer.

File the copy on board.

Note: Upon request of crewing management, send the original wage accounts bearing the crewmember’s signatures to the office with monthly returns.

###### Travel Expenses

Seafarers shall submit a travel expense claim (Form ADM-06) to the master, supported by original receipts or invoices.

Reasonable travel expenses incurred while joining the vessel should be supported by receipts or invoices.

The master shall email copies of the travel expense claim and receipts to the personnel department for approval.

Once approved, the master will be instructed to credit the crewmember’s wages with the approved amount.

Note: Requests not supported by receipts or not approved by the personnel department will not be accepted.

Follow below guidelines when filling the Travel Expense Claim Form:

Clearly state the full name, rank, ship's name, port, and date of joining/leaving the ship, and the crewmember's signature.

Claim travel expenses in the same currency as agreed in the employment contract.

Handwrite the number (“No.”) from the travel expenses claim form on the appropriate voucher.

List each expense item in chronological order.

Provide a meaningful description of the nature of expenses under “Item”.

Fill in the “Amount” in local currency, the “Exchange rate” to USD/EUR, and the “Total” amount in USD/EUR.

###### Allotment Notes

Each crew member may make one allotment per month. The company will bear the charges for sending this allotment but not any charges imposed by the receiving bank.

A crew member may make more than one allotment per month but must bear all bank charges on the additional allotment(s).

Masters must send the list of allotments for the current month by e-mail to reach the office around the 10th-15th of the month.

Once a payment is requested, the master is responsible for recovering it from the crewmember’s wages, even if the crewmember is not on board when the payment is made.

To cancel an allotment payment, the master should send a message to the company and ensure receipt of an acknowledgment confirming the cancellation.

Note: Payment of the allotment will proceed if not removed from crew remittance.

Complete separate allotment lists as follows:

Allotments to be paid into Sri Lankan banks - in USD

Allotments to be paid into Philippine banks – in USD

Allotments to be paid into European/other banks – separate in USD and EUR

For European/other banks, the master shall send an abstract from Payroll Software showing valid bank details for each crew and the allotment amount.

Seafarers joining from Europe will not normally complete allotment details prior to arrival on board.

Seafarers from the Philippines and Sri Lanka generally complete allotment requests when engaged, but these may be altered.

The master shall check the amount and date of commencement of the allotment when the crewmember arrives on board.

Filipino crewmembers must remit a minimum of 80% of their basic salary for every full month on board.

Filipino crew shall present their “letter of assignment” to the master, stating the joining allotment amount, and enter this as extra allotment.

An extract from the crew remittance in Crew Management Software is forwarded directly to the paying bank. Ensure full and precise details of the beneficiaries’ bank account, including BIC/SWIFT codes, are sent to the office and entered in crew remittance.

Submit allotment lists for, Sri Lanka, and Philippine banks using the ‘List of Allotment Form’ and enter amounts in crew remittances in Crew Management Software.

Allotments must be in USD or EUR as applicable. Submit lists with complete details each month for all personnel and confirm any amendments with full details.

###### Cash Advances to Crew

The master must ensure a seaman has sufficient balance to his credit before giving a cash advance.

Cash advances should not be drawn in large amounts (up to max. USD 200) and are meant for covering expenses during shore leave (e.g., taxi, food, beverages, souvenirs).

###### Special Payments

In emergencies where a crewmember needs money to be send home in addition to the normal monthly allotment:

The master should notify the company of the special payment details.

Reimbursement can be by deduction in the allotment column of the monthly payroll or the crewmember can hand the cash to the master.

Credit the left side of the master’s cash account with USD or EUR as applicable.

Caution: The company covers bank transfer charges for monthly allotments, but crew members must bear charges on special payments.

For urgent needs the master must ensure the requested special allotment amount does not exceed the estimated balance of wages at the end of the month.

###### Cash to Master Request

Master should request cash to master in USD and EUR, clearly indicating the currency required.

Provide at least ten (10) clear working days’ notice.

When requesting cash, indicate:

- Balance in currencies on board at the time of the request

- CTM required and denomination

- Anticipated major expenditures (e.g., cash advance for crew, crew FWA, general stores, emergency cash)

Insurance covers a maximum of EUR 50,000 or equivalent for cash on board. Lock ship’s cash in the master’s safe. Make cash advances to crew members as soon as possible after receiving the cash on board to reduce the amount held by the master.

###### Monthly Balance of Wages

Occasionally, monthly payrolls show a seaman with a negative balance after receiving their monthly pay, meaning the seaman owes money to the company.

Ensure seafarers always maintain a positive balance.

If a seaman owes money to the company upon disembarking, the master will be held responsible for making up the balance owed.

If a seaman has a negative balance, restrict cash advances and canteen accounts onboard until the seaman is no longer in debt to the company.

The company does not loan money to seafarers, and masters are not authorized to give cash advances in this way.

The master shall control and administer the slop chest.

During Routine Periods:

- Ensure that the slop chest is open at regular and convenient times for the crew to purchase items, as far as the vessel's trade allows.

- Crewmembers should sign for slop chest items received during the month. Deduct the value of these items from their monthly payroll.

- Endeavor to re-stock the bond at the most economical locations. If necessary, add up to 10% of the purchase price of bond items to cover any wastage and transportation costs.

- When using items from the slop chest for owner or charterer representation, recover the cost through the master's cash account (Form ACCT 01).

- Attach a representation account (Form ACCT 05) to the cash account to support the deductions made.

- Recover the sales of slop chest items by either crediting yourself on the payroll or taking a cash advance equivalent to the amount deducted from the crew for slop chest items.

During Change of Command:

- Manage the slop chest carefully, especially during the handover to the relieving master.

- Ensure the slop chest does not contain excessive stocks of “difficult to sell” items.

Note: The suggested value of the slop chest is around USD 2,000.

When there is a change of command, agree with the relieving master on the value of the slop chest on board and receive money from them for the value of slop chest items.

Effect payment for the slop chest in one of three ways:

- The relieving master can take a personal cash advance from the master's cash account and pay the relieved master.

- The relieving master can request the office to make an allotment to the relieved master and debit the amount to them on the payroll.

- The relieving master can make a direct settlement in cash or by traveler’s check from personal funds.

Note: Paying for the slop chest may result in the relieving master's account of wages being in arrears, which is acceptable for the first month after joining a vessel.

## 1.4 Communication



### 1.4.1 Dealing with Media - rev 0 Issued 18.12.2024

##### Dealing with the Media

###### Introduction

This procedure guides crew members on how to respond when dealing with the media.

###### Responsibilities

The Master, Vessel’s Heads of Department, and Office Management are responsible for ensuring that media policies are communicated to their teams and that their conduct sets a good example in this respect.

###### Definitions

Media Response Coordinator: A professional or third-party company designated by REEDEREI NORD to assist with crisis communication and media response during a maritime incident/accident.

###### Guidance on Dealing with Media and Media Response

Media will always try to contact or interview every crew member who has witnessed or might have information about an incident on board. They may call the affected vessel’s phone or approach anyone else on the vessel or in the office via private social media channels.

If the charterer has invited the media on board to promote their service, the Master should first ascertain if the owner has given permission. If not, they should contact the operations department for advice.

The Master, office employees, and crew members shall follow below guidelines:

- Only the Master is authorized to deal with the media on behalf of the Company.

- Media should not be allowed on board the vessel during an incident or ongoing investigation as it could affect ongoing operations.

- Any requests from the media for interviews with crew members during an incident or ongoing investigation must be denied.

Note:    Everything you say or post on social media may harm the Company’s reputation, as well as your own and your family’s. Consider all consequences before you say or post anything.

Master:

- Have the “Holding” Media Statement ready, including the contact details of the Media Response Coordinator, provided by the REEDEREI NORD responsible office media Coordinator.

    - Example:

    - "As the Master of M/V………………, I am currently dealing with this incident. My main priorities are to protect the safety of my crew members and the marine environment from any (further) damage. I would like to resolve this incident as soon as possible. Please contact our Media Response Coordinator or the Office Emergency Response Team for updated information on this unfortunate incident."

Be cooperative - note the number and the name of the media person who contacted you and send it to the office for further handling.

Direct the conversation - when giving the statement, provide minimal information, avoid giving personal opinions or speculations, and direct the media to the Media Response Coordinator and office Media Coordinator.

Remain calm, kind, transparent, but firm – confirm the ongoing incident but state that further details will be provided by the office Media Coordinator or the Media Response Coordinator. Inform the media that your line must remain open for emergencies and politely end the call.

Calls from family members – treat them with respect, but do not reveal any information about any crew member. Take their name and number and inform the Crewing Personnel so they can handle it.

Do not make “off the record” statements or comments.

Crew Onboard and Office Employees:

Deny requests for comments or interviews – inform the media that you are not authorized to give any information and that they should follow official statements from the Company.

Do not post anything online during the incident and while the investigation is ongoing – your posts may harm or intimidate you, your family, your colleagues and their families, and cause reputational and financial damage to the Company.

Do not respond to people you don’t know on social media – the media will try to use every possible channel to ask about the incident. It is best to ignore them or report such messages to the Master or the office so they can handle them.

Calls from family members – treat them with respect, but do not reveal any information about any crew member. Take their name and number and inform the Crewing Personnel so they can handle it.

Do not make “off the record” statements or comments.

##### Long-Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT)

###### Introduction

The Long-Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) system enables global identification and tracking of ships using existing GMDSS equipment on board, as mandated by SOLAS regulation 19-1.

This regulation allows Contracting Governments to undertake long-range identification and tracking of ships.

Compliance Testing: All LRIT equipment must undergo a compliance test upon initial installation or hardware replacement.

An LRIT Conformance report has no expiry date and requires no further tests.

Ships shall automatically transmit the following LRIT information:

- Identity of the ship

### 1.4.4 Standard Onboard Communication - rev 0 issued 18.12.2024

##### Standard Onboard Communication

###### Introduction

Navigational and safety communications from ship to shore and vice versa, from ship to ship, and onboard ship must be precise, simple and unambiguous so as to avoid confusion and errors.

The Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP) has been compiled:

- To assist in the greater safety of navigation and of the conduct of the ship,

- To standardize the language used in communication for navigation at sea, in port-approaches, in waterways, harbors and onboard vessels with multilingual crews, and

- To assist maritime training institutions in meeting the objectives mentioned above.

The IMO SMCP includes phrases which have been developed to cover the most important safety-related fields of verbal shore-to-ship (and vice-versa), ship-to-ship and on-board communications.

The aim is to get round the problem of language barriers at sea and avoid misunderstandings which can cause accidents.

Use the SMCP as often as possible in preference to other wording of similar meaning.

Users should adhere as closely as possible to their wording in relevant situations.

In this way they are intended to become an acceptable safety language, using English for the verbal interchange of intelligence among individuals of all maritime nations on the many and varied occasions when precise meanings and translations are in doubt, increasingly evident under modern conditions at sea.

The ability to understand and use the SMCP is required for the certification of officers in charge of a navigational watch on ships of 500 gross tonnage or above under the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978, as amended.

###### Rules for Communication

The IMO SMCP requires a basic knowledge of the English language, and key rules should be taken into account to eliminate any possibility of misunderstandings:

- Use simplified English, avoid the use of synonyms and contracted forms

- Provide fully worded answers to yes/no questions (and basic alternative answers to sentence questions)

- Avoid ambiguous words such as “may”, “might”, “should”, “could”, “would” and, sometimes, “can”

- Transmissions by radiotelephony shall be made slowly and distinctly and each word clearly pronounced to facilitate transcription

PART A provides the following criteria to build up a good communication:

- SPELLING: According to the rules contained in the International Code of Signals

Example: “Please spell your call sign”, “My call sign is: OJQC- Oscar, Juliett, Quebec, Charlie”

- MESSAGE MARKERS: Words to be placed before particular sentences to make the scope of the contact clear. When communication takes place within VTS, there are 8 different markers:

- INSTRUCTION (Send by authorities on the basis of a regulation, it is compulsory for the recipient, unless for safety reasons)

- ADVICE (usually sent by an authorities on the basis of a recommendation, so it is not strictly compulsory for the recipient)

- WARNING (related to a danger)

- INFORMATION (usually applied for navigational and traffic information)

- QUESTION (used to remove ambiguity between questions and statements)

- ANSWER (following a question)

- REQUEST (usually applied for services, not to be used for traffic because of the possible discordances with COLREGs)

- INTENTION (usually for a navigation action).

- RESPONSES: Should contain an appropriate phrase in full after yes/no, while in case of instruction or advice the recipient should repeat the order (read back) in affirmative or negative way “I will/can” or “I will not/cannot”.

- Example: “Are you under way?” “Yes I am under way” and “INSTRUCTION: report at next waypoint at 1200 hours UTC” “I will report at next waypoint at 1200 hours UTC”

- CORRECTIONS: When wrong information is given the message should be stopped by the world “mistake” and then the right sentence should be repeated after saying “correction”

- Example: “My course is 060 degrees – mistake – correction: my course is 070 degrees”

- NUMBERS: Except for wheel orders dealing with rudder angles, numbers should be spoken in separate digits and when decimals are used they should be preceded by the word “decimal” or “point”.

Example: “ My course is three-one-five” or “my draft is eight decimal two meters”

- POSITIONS: Latitude and longitude values shall be expressed in degrees and minutes or decimals of a minute.  When talking about positions the word “reported” should be used when position is unconfirmed, otherwise the word “located” should be used.

    - Example: “My position is 57 degrees 14 minutes North 006 degrees 37 decimal 5 minutes West” or “Adrift container reported in position is 57 degrees 14 minutes North 006 degrees 37 decimal 5 minutes West”

- BEARINGS AND COURSES: Expressed in 360 degrees notation from the True North (relative bearings are measured from the vessel’s head and can follow the same 360 degrees notation or be expressed in 180 degrees notation in relation to the port or starboard bow)

- When a mark is involved, to avoid any case of ambiguity it should be specified if the direction is from the vessel or from the mark.

    - Example: “Tug is bearing 340 degrees from your position” or “My position is bearing 080 degrees from Brans Ness lighthouse” or “Safe water buoy 020 degrees on your starboard bow”

- DISTANCES: Expressed in nautical miles or cables (tenths of a mile).

Example: “Visibility is 2 nautical miles” or “My CPA to MV Cardhu is 5 cables ”

- SPEED: it has to be expressed in knots (normally the STW is given, so when referring to the COG it should be specified using “ground speed”).

Example: “I will reduce my speed to 8 knots” or “My ground speed is 13 point 4 knots”

- TIME AND GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES: Expressed in the 24 hours notation indicating whether UTC, zone time or local time is being used, while names should be the one published on the charts (in case of ambiguity geographical coordinates can be used).

Example: “My ETA at Genoa pilot station is 1830 hours UTC”

- IDENTIFICATION: When contact takes place for the first time identification should be provided immediately using the words “this is” followed by the name of the vessel, usually spoken three times, the call sign or the MMSI; for further communication the name can be repeated or “I” can be used.

Example: “This is MV Clynelish Clynelish Clynelish, call sign CFYP, MMSI 316256000”

- PROCEDURE WORDS: Words used to close a message or to state that a message has been received; the word “over” is to be used to end a message when an answer is expected, the word “out” is to be used to end a message when an answer is not expected, while the word “roger” is used to inform that the message has been received. When a message is expected the phrase “go ahead” is also used.

    - Example: “You are steering a dangerous course, over” “Roger, I will alter my course, over” “Advise you steer a new course of 340 degrees, over” “Roger, new course 340 degrees, thank you, out”.

###### Standard Marine Communication Phrases - Part A

PART A covers Phrases applicable in external communications from ship to shore, shore to ship and ship to ship as required by STCW 1978, as revised, Table A-II/1, as well as Phrases applicable on board vessels in conversations between Pilots and bridge teams as required by Regulation 14(4) of Chapter V of SOLAS 1974, as revised.

Introduction

Each seafarer employed by the Company must have a Contract of Employment (CoE) signed by both the seafarer and the company’s representative.

The seafarer must have the opportunity to examine and seek advice about the CoE before signing it, and ensure they fully understand their rights and obligations.

###### Responsibilities

The Master must check:

- That the seafarer’s name, date of birth, and nationality on the contract match those in their passport and discharge book.

- That the seafarer is properly qualified for their rank.

- That the seafarer fully understands the duration of their contract and their pay scale.

The Master shall:

- Maintain strict control over the duration of the CoE for each seafarer on board and follow the minimum notification period for termination.

- Notify the Personnel Officer if the period of employment is expected to be exceeded. The Personnel Officer should issue an addendum to the CoE, which must be agreed upon and signed by all parties. E-mails are NOT acceptable as addendums.

Note: If the CoE period is exceeded due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the vessel/company's control (e.g., port/country restrictions, health issues, other local authority restrictions), a seafarer’s repatriation plan must be provided, and the flag State must be informed. The plan must ensure repatriation before a maximum continuous period of 14 months is served.

###### The Contract of Employment (CoE)

Each employment contract should include:

- Information required by ILO MLC 2006 and relevant flag state legislation

- The duration of the tour of duty

The maximum duration of service on board after which the seafarer is entitled to repatriation is 12 months. Where applicable, a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) may form part of the seafarer’s employment contract.

- ITF-IMEC IBF Reederei NORD Collective Bargaining Agreement

Note: Seafarers of all nationalities are employed under the terms of this contract.

- Standard terms and conditions governing the employment of Filipino seafarers on-board ocean-going vessels.

Note: Per Philippines local regulations, all Filipino seafarers must have this contract in addition to any standard company contract.

- Cadet Agreement for all Cadets of all nationalities excluding German Cadets (Dry fleet only).

- Individual Employment Agreements for all German seafarers (Dry fleet only).

Minimum notice for termination of employment by either the company or the seafarer shall be:

- 7 days’ notice for German seafarers during the probation period.

- 4 weeks’ notice to the 15th or the end of one month for regular German seafarers.

- 1 months’ notice for all other nationalities, except for termination during the probationary period.

Each seafarer is entitled to paid leave of at least 9 days per month of employment.

###### Preparing the Contract of Employment

Contracts of employment shall be prepared by:

- NORD Personnel Department: CoE will be emailed for signing, and two originals will be sent to the vessel by Mail Batch. One will remain with the crewmember, and the other shall be returned to the personnel department by Mail Batch.

- Manning Agency in Sri Lanka and Philippines: CoE will be signed in the manning office by the crewmember, and a copy of the CoE will be hand-carried by the crewmember to deliver to the Master.

- Familiarize themselves with the provisions of the IBF-ITF-Reederei Nord Collective Bargaining Agreement or other CBA or individual employment agreement before signing the contract.

Note: Full text of CBA is available onboard vessels and at respective manning offices.

###### Extension of Contracts

Any crewmember willing to extend their period of contract on board should make a written request to the master of the vessel.

The master should advise the office of all requests by email and indicate if he supports the request.

In deciding whether to support the request, the master must consider the crewmember's work performance and the period they have already served on board.

To avoid any complications and assist with crew planning, the personnel department should receive all requests for extensions 2 to 3 months before the end of the crewmember's contract.

Addendum to Contract of Employment shall be signed and attached to the CoE as proof of mutual agreement.

###### Disclosure of Contracts of Employment

The master shall file copies of all crew contracts of employment in one location.

- The crewmember

- Company senior managers

- Superintendents

- Personnel officers

- ITF representatives

Following the entry into force of ILO Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) 2006, individual employment contracts and applicable CBAs may be reviewed by MLC (Flag State and Port State Control) Inspectors.

Caution: Do not show contracts of employment to any parties other than those specified above.

###### Use of Private Recruitment and Placement Services

The company employs the services of approved manning agents in several countries from which sea staff is most recruited. The company does not use any crew agent exclusively in a particular country and reserves the right to recruit from any source in the country.

##### Evaluation Reports

Introduction

Evaluation reports are crucial for crew planning, enabling the company to:

- Assign crewmembers to suitable ships.

- Promote crewmembers to higher positions.

- Avoid re-employing those with poor performance or social behavior.

Reports should be meaningful, factual, and objective, aiding seafarers' career development and the Personnel Department's future planning. Evaluations should not be personal. Inaccurate high grades without appropriate comments or overly negative reports on previously well-evaluated seafarers should be questioned. Recommendations for promotion must be supported by completed advancement cards (Ship’s Form, ADM 22).

###### Procedure

The Master ensures reports are completed on time, signs all reports, and completes reports for the Chief Officer, Chief Engineer, and other officers or ratings if needed.

The Chief Officer completes reports for junior deck officers, deck ratings (including IDF foreman / bosun), the pumpman, cook, and messman.

The Chief Engineer completes reports for engineer officers, engine ratings (including fitter).

Whoever writes the report and/or the master should discuss the report with the concerned crewmember to enable improvement, providing a copy of the report. "Potential for promotion" applies when promotion isn't based solely on time served and is supported by advancement cards.

Send evaluation reports to the office for following cases:

- Any crewmember upon completion of probationary periods.

- Any crewmember when signing off without a previous report in the last month.

- Departmental crewmembers without reports, upon changeover of chief officer/chief engineer.

- Any crewmember without a report, upon changeover of the master.

- Any crewmember, upon the Office's request.

When recommending a seafarer for promotion attach a properly filled advancement card signed by the Head of Department and the master, ensuring the seafarer completed relevant training and demonstrated competence in all subjects.

Use company form ADM 13 for these reports.

###### Crew evaluation by Office

Company Inspectors/Auditors shall evaluate crew performance during their visits on board while carrying out internal audits and inspections.

Crew evaluations are submitted to Personnel Department for review.

###### Newly Promoted Master – Initial Assessment

Each newly promoted Master taking over command will be assessed by the outgoing Master, on completion of the overlap period. The outgoing Master will send this assessment report to the Personnel and Operations departments before disembarkation. Form ADM 13A should be used for this purpose.

The onboard training provides cadets with practical experience to supplement the theoretical knowledge gained in college. The senior management should adopt innovative training techniques for continuous formal and casual training. Familiarity with shipboard life is also essential to the cadet's education. The cadet must acquire the requisite sea time to qualify for the required competency examinations.

###### Cadet Training Record Book

The cadet record book:

- Ensures satisfactory documentation for onboard training.

- Serves as a tool for the training officer and shipboard management to fulfill training requirements.

Training officers, heads of departments, and masters should familiarize themselves with the structure and instructions in the cadet training record books, particularly Section 1 – ‘Guide to Completion.’

The cadet shall ensure the cadet record book is completed satisfactorily and reviewed and signed. When the cadets embark the vessel, they bring the cadet record book containing various tasks they shall complete during their sea service period onboard. Even if cadets have a cadet record book issued by their respective college, they shall also use and follow the company’s cadet record book supplied from the office.

Note: Training record books issued in English or bilingual must be completed in English. Training record books completed in non-English should not be signed or acknowledged by any officer onboard.

To add value to the training process onboard, management shall evaluate additional topics or subjects required for the cadet to understand and adopt the company's work culture and effectively carry out their duties as an officer. Complete and sign the cadet record book as per the procedures laid down in the record book.

A cadet shall follow the NORD Academy Cadet Program to complete assignments (written tasks, projects listed in the Cadet Training Record Book). NORD Academy Cadet Program assignments align with Cadet Training Record Book requirements but are stricter and align with the company Mission, Vision, and Values.

###### Cadet Evaluation

The purpose of the evaluation is to objectively assess the individual's performance against a range of criteria. It is an essential tool in monitoring each cadet's training and development. The training officer shall evaluate the cadet. The master and HoD should add necessary comments. The personnel department may sometimes request an additional evaluation.

The cadet should be evaluated:

- After the first month from joining

- Every month thereafter

- Upon cadet’s signing off

- At any other time deemed appropriate by the master or training officer (to highlight exceptionally good or poor performance)

- At the request of the company

The training officer shall first fill in an evaluation form. The master shall then complete the evaluation by adding detailed comments and signing the evaluation sheet. Remarks are an important feature of this evaluation. A meeting shall be arranged with the cadet where the master and the training officer will discuss his performance, highlighting strengths and drawbacks.

Upon completing each contract and returning home, the cadet shall provide feedback about the quality of onboard training by sending the completed form ADM 17 (PERS 36) to the Company. The Master shall instruct the cadet to do so at the time of the cadet’s signing off, providing him with the blank form. Onboard evaluation reports and any issues about the quality of training raised by the cadet shall be discussed at the cadet’s post-employment debriefing.

###### Final Stage of Cadets Training and Assessment

The shipboard management shall ensure that well-organized training procedures have been completed before the cadet is signed off to continue shore-based theoretical junior officers' education. The cadet must have received knowledge, training, and experience in basic skills as a watchkeeping junior officer to perform such duties independently under both ordinary and hectic conditions.

Training and assessment of cadets in their last three months should focus on basic proficiencies in duties related to the job as watchkeeping officers on the bridge, deck, or engine control room. If a cadet cannot be assessed as having sufficient skills, the shipboard management shall inform the personnel department by email.

###### Working Hours for Cadets

Cadets’ work and rest hour periods will be governed by STCW regulations in force. Rest periods may be interrupted for essential activities, such as entering/leaving port, major engine overhaul, cargo operations, or any other operation/task deemed necessary for education/training by the master or designated officer. These guidelines do not apply in emergency situations or during emergency exercises.

As with all seafarers, cadets shall not be directly exposed to potential hazards or dangers. Extra diligence and supervision should be given to cadets, considering:

- Their lack of experience

- Absence of awareness of existing or potential dangers

- Their incomplete maturity

Cadets are onboard for training only and should not be used to fulfil roles or jobs typically undertaken by qualified and skilled ship staff unless it is part of the training process, after proper instruction and under supervision. Maintenance duties assigned by the HoD should be considered an important part of training. All cadets shall have sufficient time to study to complete the theoretical assignments in the training record book.

### 3.4.12 Death of a Crewmember - rev 0 issued 18.10.2024

##### Death of a Crewmember

Introduction: In the unfortunate event of a crewmember's death onboard, adhere to the procedures outlined in the International Medical Guide for Ships for confirming the death and handling the body.

Guidelines

Handling a Deceased Crewmember: Record the time of discovery, body temperature, position and location of the body, temperature of the area where the body was found, and take photographs of the body from different angles if a crewmember is found dead.

Immediately inform the Personnel Director/Crewing Director by telephone. In cases involving criminal activity or suspicious circumstances, provide necessary details for local police arrangements at the next port via email.

The personnel department will notify the Crewing agent or crewmember's family, the vessel's P&I club, flag state authorities, and the agent at the vessel's next port of call.

The agent should inform local authorities, local flag state consul, and the local embassy or consulate representing the crewmember's country.

Official Records: Make an entry in the deck logbook detailing the name, rank, Discharge Book No. / Passport No., time of death, vessel's location (Lat / Long if at sea), and cause of death.

Collect evidence regarding the death, ensuring the medical logbook is complete if the crewmember died under medical care. Initiate an investigation promptly for deaths due to accidents, suspected crimes, or other reasons.

Body Handling: Retain the body onboard in most cases until reaching the next port, utilizing the vessel's cold stores if more than two days from port. Refer to The International Medical Guide for Ships for guidance.

Compile a comprehensive report including full details of the deceased, time and location of death, cause of death, evidence, witness statements, log extracts, actions taken in case of a person lost overboard, copies of messages informing authorities and next-of-kin, list of personal effects and cash, and signatures of the master and another crewmember. Send a copy of the report to the personnel department and attach it to the deck logbook. Additional copies may be required by the attending authorities.

Check the safe manning certificate and request a dispensation letter from the Flag State if deficiencies are found. Sign-off the crewmember from the crew articles and complete their discharge book.

### 3.4.13 Crewmember Family Onboard - rev 0 issued 18.10.2024

##### Crewmember’s Family on Board

###### Introduction

The company allows officers to bring their wives and children on board under specific conditions.

These include completing at least six months of employment with the company and restrictions on wives joining during the officer's initial month on a new vessel.

Safety concerns prohibit families from being on board during dry-dock stays. Senior ratings may be granted this privilege at the company's discretion, with the following limitations:

- Total number of accompanying relatives should not exceed 5 at any one time.

- Accompanying children should be at least 2 years old.

- Accompanying wives should not be pregnant. Should a wife become pregnant during stay onboard, arrangements to disembark should be made immediately.

- Wives and children are not permitted to remain on the vessel for longer than 2 months without express permission from the personnel department.

- Officers may have their wives / children onboard only once for the duration of the contract.

###### Responsibilities

- Crewmembers must ensure their family members possess valid travel documents such as passports, visas, and vaccination certificates, and cover all travel costs. If the vessel may visit a U.S. port, crewmembers are responsible for ensuring their family holds valid U.S. visas.

- Crewmembers must submit written requests directly to the company or through the vessel's master.

- The Master grants permission based on accommodation, lifeboat capacity, and safety equipment availability.

Joining Procedure

- The crewmember shall provide the company with medical certificates for his wife and children.

- The personnel department will make necessary arrangements for the wife and children to join a vessel if this is requested by the crewmember.

- Once all travel arrangements, visas etc. have been finalized; the personnel department shall inform the master of the vessel and the agent at the port of embarkation.

- The crewmember and the respective family member should sign an indemnity form for each family member immediately upon embarking. (Form ADM 03)

Completed

###### General Information

Crewmembers are responsible for all travel costs for their families, with the personnel department informing the master of these expenses for deduction from the crewmember's salary.

No maintenance charge is levied for the first 30 days of the wife and children's stay, but thereafter, a daily fee is charged to cover victualling costs ($6.00 for adults and $3.00 for children younger than 14, per day).

The ship's staff doesn't provide special catering for wives and children, with wives expected to maintain their husband's cabin. Accompanying family should sign on the ship’s articles as supernumeraries. In some ports, it may be necessary to declare accompanying passengers on a separate list to crew.

Crewmembers' wives and children are covered for medical emergencies by the company's P&I cover, with the crewmember liable for deductibles in case of a claim.

The company arranges deviation insurance to cover expenses incurred if the vessel deviates to land a wife or child.

The master should provide the personnel department with the full details of the wife or child joining the vessel, including name, age, date of joining, and intended duration on board.

Crewmembers should obtain insurance cover for potential expenses not covered by the company, such as high hotel and travel costs for repatriation due to sickness or accident.

If a crewmember cannot obtain necessary visas, the master must disembark the wife and children before proceeding to the U.S., with the personnel department informing about any additional visa requirements.

Any fines resulting from a crewmember's family violating visa requirements will be the responsibility of the crewmember.

The personnel department must inform the master of all visa requirements for a crewmember's family intending to join a vessel.

### 3.4.17 Discipline Procedure - rev 0 issued 18.10.2024

##### Discipline

###### Introduction

Order and discipline are essential for the safe and effective operation of a ship. The atmosphere does not need to be harsh or repressive. Orders given should be unambiguous, precise, and reasonable, and those receiving the orders should respond promptly and efficiently. The master's orders must be obeyed, and his decision is final, reflecting his responsibility and accountability.

###### Responsibilities

The Master:

- Responsible for maintaining discipline on board, assisted by the Chief Officer and Chief Engineer.

- Must give unambiguous, precise, and reasonable orders.

- Should contact the Personnel department for advice on disciplinary actions if in doubt.

The Personnel Department:

- Ensures that any disciplinary action taken by the Master complies with company policies, seafarers’ employment contracts, company’s ISM Manual, and

- keep proper records of each disciplinary action.

Company Inspectors: if any crew member is found during the inspection in breach of company policies, procedures, or contractual obligations, the Inspector has the right and responsibility to take appropriate disciplinary action.

Note: Ensure compliance with all company policies, employment contracts, and the ISM Manual when taking disciplinary actions. Maintain proper records of each action taken.

###### On-board Disciplinary Procedure

####### General

Occasionally, a crewmember's work performance or conduct may fall below the required standards. Often, an informal talk with the person concerned is enough to correct their behavior. However, appropriate disciplinary action should be taken if a more formal approach is justified.

The company applies a progressive disciplinary procedure to clearly identify the consequences of misconduct, human errors, or behavior, depending on the seriousness of the offense. This ensures the best outcome for the ship and the crew, as well as a just outcome for the involved crewmember. The progressive levels of disciplinary actions, listed from least to most severe, are:

- Verbal warning

- Written warning

- Final written warning

- Dismissal

Progressive disciplinary actions should be applied uniformly and impartially, as felt appropriate in the specific circumstances of each case. Each employee to whom disciplinary procedure has been applied shall clearly understand that any subsequent or similar act of misconduct or underperformance will result in a more severe disciplinary action. Omit any of the progressive steps outlined above depending on the seriousness of the offense.

####### Disciplinary Procedure

If the master needs to discipline a crewmember, the following points should guide the process:

- Act promptly. If possible, discipline the crewmember on the same day the offense was committed, or at least on the following day.

- In the case of drunkenness, discipline when the crewmember is sober.

- Advise the crewmember that they are the subject of disciplinary action.

- Gather incident details from the head of the department and, if necessary, get statements from witnesses.

- Investigate the facts of the case thoroughly. If a written warning or more severe action is justified, provide a clear description of the offense(s) committed, outlining the facts and results of the investigation, and refer to relevant contractual terms or articles of the applicable CBA.

- Allow explanation: Give the crewmember the opportunity to explain.

- Decide on the appropriate course of action.

- Consult personnel department in the case of a more serious offense to discuss the most appropriate disciplinary action.

- Record all actions taken. All warnings (verbal or written) and dismissals must be recorded in the ship’s logbook, and a copy sent by email to the personnel department.

A verbal warning is a reminder for most first offenses of a less serious nature, such as minor lapses of conduct and/or performance.

A written warning should be issued to document a serious first-time offense, recurring offenses, multiple offenses, or consistently poor performance. Examples of offenses for which a written warning may be appropriate include:

- Absence from duty

- Failure to carry out orders.

- Persistent poor timekeeping

- Persistent poor work performance

- Going ashore without permission

- Returning from shore leave after the expiry of shore leave.

- Insubordination

- Use of abusive language and threatening behavior towards the master, officers, or crew

- Willful damage to the vessel or equipment

A written warning is issued after the master's investigation. The crewmember has the right to seek the advice of a fellow crewmember as their witness and representative during the investigation. Allow for a probationary period, during which the crewmember will be under close observation. Failure to show improvement may result in further and more severe disciplinary action. Use Form ADM 18 for this purpose.

Issue a written warning in the presence of:

- The head of the respective department

- One more witness from the ship’s officers or crew

The crewmember should sign the written warning. If they refuse to do so, record this fact. Record the issuance of the written warning in the ship’s logbook. Provide a copy of the written warning and the logbook entry to the crewmember. Inform them that the written warning will be placed in their personal file and may be considered in future disciplinary actions against them.

A final written warning is the last attempt to correct a crewmember’s behavior before dismissing them from the vessel. It should be issued after a written warning if no improvement over the probationary period has been noted, or for a particularly serious offense when the master believes that dismissal should be considered. The case needs to be referred to the personnel manager for a final decision.

The record and procedure for issuing the final written warning should follow that of the written warning, as described above. Use Form ADM 18.

####### Dismissal Procedure

If a crewmember fails to improve or change behavior as outlined in previously issued written warnings or commits a grave offense on board, which may be classified as a serious default of employment obligations, the master must consider their dismissal from the ship.

Dismissal must always be seen as a last resort and each case must be carefully investigated and documented. While dismissal is normally preceded by the issuance of a written warning, the master must prioritize the safety and well-being of the vessel. If any crewmember endangers these, the master should not hesitate to dismiss them without notice.

Examples of offenses for which dismissal is appropriate include:

- Willful violation of the law

- Fraud and/or deliberate falsification of records

- Theft or willful damage to company property

- Misappropriation of the company’s funds or materials

- Any violation of company drug & alcohol policy and procedure

- Serious breaches of health, safety, and environmental regulations

- Deliberate or negligent actions causing loss, damage, or injury.

- Serious bullying, harassment, or fighting.

- Persistent refusal to work or sleeping on duty.

- Any conduct endangering the ship and/or other crewmembers.

- Desertion

- Persistent repetition of any offense for which written warnings are issued.

- Possession of pornographic material involving children or animals in any form (magazine, CD, USB stick, laptops, etc.)

- Bringing the company into serious disrepute

Before dismissing a crewmember, the master must contact the personnel officer/manager, to discuss reasons for dismissal and to decide the best course of action.

If the master decides to dismiss a crewmember, disciplinary action must be taken as per the crewmember's contract of employment and the applicable CBA.

Issue a dismissal notice to any crewmember who is dismissed and record in the ship’s logbook.

The dismissal notice should include:

- Details of the incident which is the cause of dismissal

- The date and time of the incident

- Reference to previously issued written warning(s), if applicable

- Reference to the company policy/procedure and/or terms of the employment contract and/or article(s) of the applicable CBA which have been violated

- A statement that the repatriation expenses and any other costs directly attributable to the incident, which led to dismissal, will be on the seafarer’s account.

Issue the dismissal notice in the presence of at least two witnesses, normally the head of the respective department and one more officer or senior rating, who should counter-sign it.

The crewmember should sign the dismissal notice. If they refuse to do so, record this fact. Copies of the dismissal notice and the logbook entry should be handed over to the crewmember.

Send all records relating to a dismissal case to the personnel department as soon as possible after the dismissal has taken place. Mail the original records and documents to the personnel department with the first monthly returns.

####### Incident Investigation Procedure

In the case of an on-board operational incident, investigate. The root cause investigation process is designed to reveal systemic factors that result in human error. However, there may be situations where personal accountability in an incident may warrant disciplinary action.

When personal/behavioral causes have been identified through the incident investigation process, apply the progressive disciplinary procedure. In deciding whether a crewmember who caused or was involved in an incident should be subject to disciplinary action, consider the following:

- Whether the crewmember involved in the incident was trained, qualified, and competent.

- Whether instructions issued were clear and correctly understood by the crewmember.

- Whether the procedure for completing the job is workable and has been safely followed before by peers.

- Whether the actions that led to the incident were as intended and whether the consequences could be foreseen.

- Whether the risks associated with the job were properly and correctly assessed.

- Whether there were any distracting factors preventing the crewmember from doing the job safely.

Disciplinary action will not be part of the corrective actions in the incident investigation process.

Disciplinary action will inevitably follow if the investigation reveals that a crewmember:

- Knowingly and intentionally did not follow the standard procedure or policy.

- Recklessly violated the procedure or policy.

- Was unacceptably negligent.

Apply the progressive disciplinary procedure as specified above, depending on how serious the consequences of the incident are or could potentially have been. The previous history of unsafe acts or risky behaviors of the crewmember in question will also affect the decision about the level of disciplinary action.

Additional training of crewmembers involved in an incident may be required as part of follow-up action.

####### Post-Disembarkation Disciplinary Procedure

Occasionally, it may be necessary to bring to the attention of an officer, particularly a senior officer from the company’s regular pool, after their disembarkation, that the company expects improvement in certain areas of performance or attitude.

Examples of when this would be done:

- Deficiencies or mismanagement discovered on the vessel during technical or marine inspections at the time when an officer was on board or after their disembarkation.

- Vessel’s commercial, vetting, or PSC performance was below the expected standard.

- Issues with day-to-day communication with the head office or a particular department.

- The maintenance or cosmetic condition of the vessel has noticeably declined.

- Incident investigation revealed that some procedures, policies, or standard practices were not followed.

The main purpose of post-employment discussions about an officer’s possible shortcomings or operational/technical issues is to have an open and fair dialogue, aimed at clarifying the company’s requirements and expectations while giving the officer the opportunity to present their side of the story to clear up any misunderstandings.

Initially, an officer would normally be contacted by the personnel, operations, or technical manager over the phone or Skype to raise the company’s concerns informally. If a more detailed discussion is anticipated or a wider range of issues require discussion, an officer may be invited to visit the head office for a debriefing.

An invitation to visit the head office should not be regarded as the initiation of disciplinary action against an officer. The company promotes dialogue between the office and sea staff, and senior officers are often invited to the head office to become more familiar with the shore side of company operations.

If the issues leading to the post-employment discussion are more serious or if the officer’s overall performance needs careful re-evaluation, the following formal progressive steps may be applied:

- Record of discussion

- Guidance letter

- Warning letter

- Letter of termination

Any of the measures above may be applied, depending on the seriousness of the transgression. Previous records of disciplinary actions and/or performance-related issues will be considered when deciding on the level of post-disembarkation disciplinary action.

### 3.4.18 Complaint Handling Procedure - rev 0 issued 18.10.2024

##### Complaint Handling

Introduction

Ensure appropriate procedures to address onboard complaints regarding breaches of ILO MLC 2006 requirements, including seafarer's rights.

Applies to all Reederei Nord ships. All complaints are investigated seriously, confidentially, and fairly. No one will be victimized for making a complaint.

###### Complaint Handling Guidance

Every crewmember can seek redress for their complaint as soon as possible, at the lowest level. If unsatisfied with the decision, they can appeal to a higher management level.

The complainant must submit the complaint in writing within five days of the occurrence, following this hierarchy:

- Superior officer

- Head of the department

- Master

Each level has five days to resolve the complaint. Complaints should be resolved at the lowest level possible. If unresolved, escalate to the next level.

Seafarers can complain directly to the master and, if necessary, to the flag state administration, MLC 2006 contact point, or appropriate external authorities.

The master handles complaints personally and may seek assistance from the company’s MLC 2006 Designated Person (DP) or another appointed person. If the master cannot resolve the complaint, the seafarer has ten days to escalate it through the master to the company, initially addressing the personnel officer in charge of the vessel or directly to the company if prejudicial to the master.

The company and seafarer have twenty days to resolve the matter. If unresolved after twenty days, either party has a further twenty days to bring the matter to the Flag State Maritime Administration (MLC 2006 Contact Point).

Complainant seafarers have the right to be accompanied and represented by another seafarer of their choice on board the ship during the complaints procedure. The complainant shall not be victimized.

All complaints and decisions must be recorded, with a copy provided to the complainant.

###### Records / Forms

- Use forms ADM 33 and ADM 33A when needed.



### 3.4.2 Rest Hours - Fatigue - rev 0 issued 18.10.2024

##### Fatigue

###### Definition

Fatigue is a state of feeling tired, weary or sleepy resulting from prolonged mental or physical work, extended periods of anxiety, exposure to harsh environments or loss of sleep leading to impaired performance and diminished alertness.

The effects of fatigue are particularly dangerous in the shipping industry which requires constant alertness and intense concentration from its workers. Fatigue is dangerous because it affects everyone regardless of skill, knowledge and training.

###### Responsibilities

Master shall implement these instructions.

Heads of Department shall follow fatigue management strategies for management-level seafarers.

All crew shall monitor and seek appropriate treatments for any health concerns that may influence their fitness for duty.

###### General Effects of Fatigue

Fatigue significantly reduces alertness, impairing decision-making, and attention. Affects every aspect of human performance: physical, emotional, and mental.

Known Effects on Performance:

- Increased susceptibility to errors of attention and memory (e.g., omitting steps in sequences).

- Chronically fatigued individuals often choose riskier strategies due to requiring less effort.

- Slower response to stimuli and reduced problem-solving abilities.

Consequences:

- Reduced individual and crew effectiveness and efficiency.

- Decreased productivity and lower work standards.

- Increased likelihood of errors.

###### Signs and Effects of Fatigue

####### Physically

- Inability to stay awake (e.g., head nodding, involuntary sleep).

- Difficulty with hand-eye coordination (e.g., switch selection).

- Speech difficulties (e.g., slurred, slowed, garbled speech).

- Heaviness in limbs, sluggishness, decreased physical force.

- Frequent dropping of objects, non-specific discomfort, headaches.

- Symptoms like giddiness, heart palpitations, rapid breathing.

- Loss of appetite, insomnia, sudden sweating, leg pains, digestion issues.

####### Emotionally:

- Increased risk-taking behavior.

- Greater intolerance and anti-social behavior.

- Increased worry and reduced motivation.

- Mood changes (e.g., irritability, tiredness, depression).

####### Mentally:

- Poor judgement of distance, speed, time.

- Misinterpretation of situations, focusing on minor problems.

- Slow or absent responses to normal, abnormal, or emergency situations.

- Reduced attention span, difficulty concentrating, and thinking clearly.

Note: Fatigue's impact on alertness is especially evident during tasks requiring sustained attention, like night watch. Fatigue can cause significant performance impairments, affecting decision-making, response time, judgement, and coordination.

###### Fatigue Management Strategies

Compliance and Scheduling: Ensure compliance with minimum hours of rest and maximum hours of work. Use rested personnel for covering shifts of those traveling long hours. Heads of departments must ensure that newly joined crew have time to overcome fatigue and familiarize themselves with the vessel.

Workload Management:

- Manage time spent on physically and mentally demanding tasks like tank cleaning or navigation.

- Avoid scheduling hazardous tasks during circadian lows.

- Rotate tasks to break monotony and balance high-demand and low-demand tasks.

Nutrition and Hydration: Serve nutritious food and provide continuous access to drinking water. Offer appropriate meal choices for night-time personnel.

Shipboard Conditions: Improve conditions to facilitate uninterrupted sleep, including maintaining HVAC systems, replacing light bulbs, and eliminating unusual noise promptly. Schedule drills and maintenance to minimize disturbances.

Communication and Reporting: Foster open communication about fatigue, ensuring no recriminations for reporting. Promote interaction between shore and vessel management regarding fatigue awareness.

Training and Awareness: Provide training to recognize and manage fatigue. Emphasize the importance of adequate sleep during rest periods. Educate on personal fatigue mitigation strategies.

Monitoring and Verification: Monitor and verify that all personnel are getting adequate sleep. Keep individual records of hours of rest or work.

Work Patterns and Resource Utilization: Reappraise work patterns and responsibilities to use resources efficiently. Share long cargo operations among all deck officers.

Supportive Environment: Promote supportive relationships and handle interpersonal conflicts. Increase awareness of healthy lifestyle benefits (exercise, relaxation, nutrition).

Fatigue Incident Management: Establish practices for handling and learning from fatigue incidents. Ensure effective communication during watch and work handovers.

Notes:

Heads of departments should ensure newly joined crewmembers have proper time to overcome fatigue and become familiar with the vessel.

Avoid noisy work close to accommodation and establish quiet periods onboard to enhance rest.

Continuous interaction between company and vessel management is crucial for effective fatigue awareness and prevention.

Timely coordination of scheduled activities is essential to avoid unnecessary strain on the crew.

Monitoring compliance with maritime regulations on work and rest hours is fundamental to prevent fatigue.

##### Hours of Rest

The company adhere to minimum hours of rest as per STCW, ILO Maritime Labor Convention (MLC), and vessel’s flag administration. The company provides a software for planning and maintaining rest hour records and work schedules.

STCW / ILO MLC 2006 - Minimum Hours of Rest:

- 10 hours in any 24-hour period.

- 77 hours in any seven-day period.

- Rest can be split into no more than two periods, with one at least 6 hours long, and intervals between rest periods not exceeding 14 hours.

Exceptions and Emergencies: Rest period requirements may be waived in emergencies or overriding operational conditions.

Flag administrations may permit exceptions, allowing rest periods not less than 70 hours in 7 days, with conditions.

Drills and Musters: Conduct musters and drills such that rest period disturbances are minimized to avoid inducing fatigue.

On-Call Situations: Provide adequate compensatory rest if normal rest is disturbed by callouts.

Rest Period Violations: If rest periods are compromised, the master should consider anchoring or berthing to ensure proper rest and immediately notify the DPA.

Watch Composition: The master and C/E should consider statutory requirements, vessel characteristics, crew competence, and expected navigational conditions when determining watch compositions.

Dry Docking Periods: Ensure compliance with work/rest hour requirements during dry docking periods.

Duty After Rest: Crew members should come on duty only after a rest period; if rest time is insufficient, postpone work until the required rest time is completed.

Emergency Work: The master can require work beyond scheduled hours for immediate safety or to assist others in distress. Post-emergency, ensure adequate rest is provided.

U.S. Waters Regulations: Licensed individuals or seamen cannot work:

- more than 15 hours in any 24-hour period or

- more than 36 hours in any 72-hour period, except in emergencies.

Maintain a record of hours worked in U.S. waters.

Documentation and Record-Keeping:

- Compile and post shipboard working/rest arrangements quarterly.

- Use form ADM 11 “Shipboard Working Arrangement” for schedules, including at least the schedule of service, minimum hours of rest, and total daily hours of rest.

- Record rest hours daily for deck and engine personnel.

- Review rest hour forms weekly for accuracy.

- Provide seafarers with a copy of their records, endorsed by the master or an authorized person.

Superintendent Oversight:

- Marine and safety superintendents must regularly check rest hour records and discuss non-conformances.

### 3.4.3 Harassment, Bullying, and Discrimination - rev 0 issued 18.10.2024

##### Harassment, Bullying, and Discrimination Procedure

###### Purpose

This framework ensures the effective implementation of the HBD Policy and provides a fair and reasonable process for resolving all HBD complaints. All complaints will be investigated seriously, confidentially, and based on fairness, sensitivity, and respect. No one will be victimized for making a complaint.

###### Scope

This procedure applies to all Reederei Nord workplaces and work-related activities. The NORD Harassment, Bullying, and Discrimination (HBD) Policy demonstrates Reederei Nord’s commitment to a safe and productive environment for all employees. Everyone working for or on behalf of Reederei Nord must maintain the workplace free from bullying and all forms of harassment. The company has zero tolerance for HBD.

###### Maintaining a Bullying and Harassment-Free Workplace

Managers and supervisors must act as role models by upholding high conduct standards to create a harmonious work environment free from intimidation, hostility, offense, and harassment. The Master on board and the Personnel Director ashore are trained to handle complaints of harassment and bullying.

Crewmembers may approach either of the two to report any incident. Do not ignore bullying or harassment; silence implies that such behavior is acceptable. Early intervention can minimize the risk of repeated behavior and prevent others from similar experiences. If crewmembers do not feel comfortable raising a complaint, they may ask a friend or colleague to do so on their behalf. Nobody will be penalized for making a complaint, provided it is not made maliciously; fairness, impartiality, sensitivity, and respect should always be maintained.

Remember, the victim’s perception of the actions is what counts. If crewmembers feel they have suffered harassment or bullying, the company will investigate the issue.

###### Definitions and Explanations

Harassment, Bullying, and Discrimination (HBD) refers to unwanted conduct causing detrimental effects such as:

- Stress

- Lack of motivation

- Reduced work performance

- Absence from duties

- Resignations

####### Harassment

####### Occupational Violence

Occupational violence is any incident where an individual is threatened or physically attacked in the workplace, including threats or physical force causing a risk to health and safety. Violence in the workplace is serious misconduct and will lead to disciplinary action.

###### Complaints Procedure

Everyone at Nord has the right to complain promptly and at the lowest possible level. Victims of harassment, bullying, and discrimination should inform the alleged perpetrator, if possible, that the conduct is unwanted. If not feasible, they can approach the master, head of department, or personnel officer. Female seafarers can raise complaints with the “Designated Person of Trust – for female seafarers,” ensuring confidentiality and providing a link between the company and female seafarers.

Upon receiving a complaint, the Master or Personnel Officer will:

- Record the dates, times, and facts of the incident(s).

- Ascertain the victim’s desired outcome.

- Explain the company’s procedures for dealing with the complaint.

- Discuss and agree on the next steps: informal or formal complaint.

- Keep a confidential record of discussions.

- Respect the victim’s choice.

Victims are entitled to assistance from a company counselor. Reederei Nord will nominate and train counselors to assist victims of sexual harassment.

####### Informal Complaints Mechanism

If the victim opts for an informal resolution, the Master or Personnel Officer will:

- Allow the alleged harasser to respond.

- Ensure the alleged harasser understands the complaints mechanism.

- Facilitate discussion for an informal resolution or refer the matter to a mediator.

- Keep a confidential record of proceedings.

- Follow up to ensure the behavior has stopped.

- Resolve the matter speedily, within 5 days of the complaint.

####### Sanctions and Disciplinary Measures

Following the investigation, those found guilty of harassment face sanctions ranging from verbal or written warnings to dismissal. If repatriation is necessary, the alleged perpetrator is typically repatriated pending investigation, but the final decision depends on circumstances. Sanctions depend on the gravity of the harassment, classified as either isolated misconduct or serious violation, with the latter resulting in dismissal.

####### Monitoring and Evaluation

Reederei Nord will monitor the implementation of this procedure, collecting anonymous data on its use and effectiveness. The Crewing Director is responsible for handling HBD cases and will report on compliance and effectiveness during Management Review meetings, including the number of incidents, how they were dealt with, and any recommendations.

Sample Collection and Analysis: Samples will be collected by an independent person appointed by the company under full chain of custody procedures. This ensures the sample provided by the named individual is not tampered with or substituted between collection and analysis.

All personal information will be kept strictly confidential.

Random Screening: The company will arrange for random drug and alcohol screening of the entire crew, including the master, in any port without prior notice.

Post-Incident Testing: Post-incident drug and alcohol testing will be arranged as required to comply with local and national regulations. Emergency sample kits for drug and alcohol testing and an Alcometer are supplied to all vessels. These must be maintained and inspected according to the maker’s instructions. Personnel involved in any serious marine incident must be tested for alcohol within two (2) hours of the incident. Drug tests via urine collection must be carried out within thirty-two (32) hours of a serious marine incident.

The company has a zero-tolerance policy for possession and consumption of any alcohol and any illegal drugs, natural or synthetic, and any other medical drugs and narcotics, used without a prescription, that interfere with the function of the brain or the body on board.

The company requires that all crew members on board the ship are always in good and healthy condition to perform their normal and emergency duties unaffected by the consequences of drugs and alcohol consumption.

Refraining from drug and alcohol abuse has long-term benefits concerning the health and well-being of the crew onboard.

To accomplish the above goals, all NORD employees must comply with the D&A policy and procedures:

Consumption of any alcoholic drink and/or illicit drugs onboard the ship is strictly prohibited.

Employees and/or any person shall not bring and/or possess any alcohol and illicit drugs/substances while on board the vessel.

Restrict consuming alcoholic drinks to shore leave. The maximum permitted alcohol content in breath after shore leave is 0.25 mg/l (outside of US territorial waters).

It is strictly prohibited to consume any kind of alcohol during shore leave in the USA.

Any crewmember must have 0.0mg/l reading on the breath analyser/tester when taking over and/or performing any duty on board.

Employees must not participate, on board or ashore, in any dealings involving illegal drugs or substances.

All employees must comply with local (country) port regulations regarding access to/within the port facility while under the influence of alcohol.

All employees returning from shore leave must be tested by a breath analyser/tester by the deck watch officer.

If the reading on the breath analyser/tester after shore leave is up to 0.25 mg/l, they shall not be allowed to take over or perform any duties on board until subsequent test show a reading of 0.0 mg/l. (The suggested waiting time is a minimum 4 hours). If the reading is above 0.25 mg/l, the employee will be violating the D&A policy and strong disciplinary action will be taken, including dismissal.

Caution: Possession, selling, use and any activity related to the illicit and/or prohibited drugs may result in a DEATH penalty in some countries (e.g. in Middle Eastern countries, Malaysia, Singapore, etc.)

###### Penalty and Disciplinary Action

The company shall dismiss, without notice, any employee who possesses or is found under the influence of alcohol and/or illicit drugs/substances on board the company’s vessels, as per the company’s disciplinary procedures. Moreover, if the terminal/port or shipyard does not permit the employee to enter the premises due to alcohol and/or drug abuse, the employee will be immediately dismissed.

All repatriation costs (including the cost of the reliever) will be paid by the offender/violator.

###### Guidelines for Drug Smuggling Prevention

The master and all crewmembers shall follow these guidelines

####### Before arrival in port

- Inform the crew going ashore of the risk that possible drug traffickers may seek to befriend them to achieve their cooperation to smuggle drugs. The crew must understand that, apart from violating company policy, this could be potentially dangerous for themselves, their families, fellow crewmembers etc. Moreover, local authorities are likely to act forcefully against any crewmember who is considered to be associated with drug traffickers.

- Display warning posters at the point of entry/exit to the vessel and within the accommodation areas describing the risks involved in the carriage of drugs.

- Keep accurate records of all activities observed and the actions taken by local authorities and other shore-based personnel and crew before entry into port, during the stay and immediately after departure.

####### Whilst in port or at anchor

- The master and crew must take all possible precautions to limit access to the vessel and monitor the surrounding area adjacent to the vessel.

- Do not allow on-board individuals who have no legitimate requirement for being onboard. If the watchperson is uncertain as to whether an individual has legitimate reasons to be on board, inform the master or chief officer. The crew should keep a log at the point of entry/exit. Accompany all visitors.

- Facilitate visual monitoring of activities during hours of darkness by keeping the areas well-lit. Report to the master if any suspicious activities are conducted by third parties on board.

- Pay attention to small boats approaching the ship and any suspicious activity in the vicinity of the ship which may warrant further investigation.

- Consider the use of a searchlight during the hours of darkness.

- Inspect the ship regularly throughout the stay in port, as required by the ship's security plan.

- Investigate if broken/missing seals for compartments, lockers, containers etc. are discovered and if nothing is found, replace the seals.

- Record the incident in the logbook, together with the result of the investigation and the relevant seal numbers.

- Perform a full search of the vessel for illegal substances and stowaways after cargo operations. If drugs are suspected to have been placed on board, the master should immediately contact the DPA or ADPA.

####### After departure

- Conduct a thorough search of all compartments once the vessel has sailed and the outbound pilot has disembarked. Record the results in the logbook.

- If drugs are found or suspected to be on board, the master should immediately contact the DPA or ADPA before contacting any other party.

####### General Precautions

- Do not touch the drugs.

- Photograph the area of the ship where the drugs were found, but leave it untouched and seal it off to prevent any unauthorized access.

- Inform DPA or ADPA.

Prohibited substances include, but are not limited to cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis/marijuana, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), methamphetamines, methadone, benzodiazepines, opioids, Synthetic mind-altering drugs such as synthetic marijuana, etc.

  - Note:	Synthetic Marijuana, also known as K2 or Spice, is a mixture of herbs, spices or shredded plant material that is typically sprayed with a synthetic compound.

####### Prescription Drugs

Any crew member taking prescription drugs (The prescription must preferably be in the English language), which may affect their job performance or behaviour must:

- Report this to the master upon joining the vessel.

- Be aware of the side effects of taking such medications.

- Carry with him a prescription from a registered medical practitioner detailing the drugs and how they must be administered.

Note:	Some prescription and over-the-counter drugs such as codeine and its variants are controlled drugs and prior permission must be taken to carry them in certain Middle Eastern countries.

##### Drug and Alcohol Testing

###### Testing Before Joining

All officers and ratings shall be screened for drugs and alcohol through routine medical examinations before joining the vessel and may be further screened during the period of employment on board the vessel.

- Each seafarer joining a tanker must carry out a fresh pre-employment D&A test before the commencement of every contract.

- D&A testing should be carried out as per OCIMF Guidelines. Each D&A test should include alcohol and the following 5 substances, as a minimum:

- Marijuana

- Cocaine

- Opiates

- Phencyclidine (PCP)

- Amphetamines

The above-mentioned drugs should be clearly shown/listed in each D&A test certificate. It is acceptable for an approved medical centre to carry out more extended tests as a routine and to include more substances in the certificate. D&A certificates with even one of the above five substances missing will not be accepted.

Note:	Each D&A certificate must list the substances a seafarer was tested for and should have marked, against each substance, whether a test for this substance was positive or negative. Doctors should not use stamps with the general statement that no illegal substances have been found. Such general statement will not be accepted.

###### Random Testing

To ensure compliance and monitor the implementation of the D&A policy, the company arranges unannounced random D&A testing using a third party approximately twice a year. The certificates for the random tests and the report containing the test results showing the port, date, name and rank of individuals who were screened on board must be recorded and shown to the vetting inspectors to confirm compliance with the company’s drug and alcohol policy.

In the case of drug and alcohol screening, the samples will be collected by an independent person appointed by the company. All stages of the process from collection to analysis will be done under full chain of custody procedures. The independent person appointed by the company will ensure that the sample analyzed was provided by the named individual under controlled conditions and with no opportunity for the sample to be tampered with or substituted at any time between its collection and analysis. All personal information will be treated with strict confidentiality.

###### Test after an Incident

The company will arrange post-incident drug and alcohol testing of officers and ratings as required to comply with local and national regulations. To enable such testing an emergency sample kit for drug & alcohol testing and an Alco meter are supplied to all vessels. Maintain the equipment and inspect it as per the maker’s instruction.

Personnel involved in any serious marine incident must be tested for alcohol within two (2) hours of the incident. Tests for drugs (urine collection) must be carried out within thirty-two (32) hours of a serious marine incident. The test kits onboard may be needed at any time and the master should keep them in safe custody and hand them over to his reliever at the change of command.

###### Onboard Alcohol Testing Procedure

Master shall

- Carry out onboard alcohol testing for randomly selected crew members whenever necessary.

- Inform the DPA or ADPA immediately if there are any violations of D&A policy.

- Carry out unannounced alcohol tests as per the random announcements from the office for all crewmembers including the master at least once a month.

- Send the reports to the office within 3 hours from the time of the request.

- The 2/O shall carry out the tests, under the supervision of the master. Both the master & the 2/O should sign the report as evidence.

- Record the date of the monthly alcohol testing of the crew members in the safety management meeting minutes.

- The master and C/E shall test the 2/O.

- The 2/O shall test the master in the presence of both the C/E & the C/O.

### 3.4.6 Seafarer's Mental Health - rev 0 issued 18.10.2024

##### Seafarers Mental Health

###### Introduction

The World Health Organization defines mental health as a “state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community.”

Seafarers face several challenges, including long working hours, shift work, extended periods away from home, living and working in the same place, lack of shore leave, adverse weather, noise and vibration, and the risk of piracy.

###### Stress

Stress occurs when life's pressures become overwhelming. It is a natural response to threats, essential for survival, and can be beneficial by enhancing performance and focus during emergencies. The fight, flight, or freeze response involves physiological changes, such as increased heart rate, faster breathing, muscle tension, and heightened senses. These reactions help prepare the body to take action in the moment.

However, repeated stress can lead to exhaustion and long-term health issues, such as headaches, high blood pressure, poor concentration, sleep difficulties, heart disease, diabetes, strokes, and weakened immunity.

Psychologically, chronic stress can cause irritability, anxiety, depression, and a sense of helplessness. It is crucial to recognize and manage stress effectively. The publication "Managing Stress and Sleeping Well at Sea" provides guidance on this.

###### How to Maximise Your Psychological Wellbeing

People with higher wellbeing scores tend to live longer, have a lower risk of heart attacks or strokes, make better decisions, and perform better at work.

Wellbeing encompasses both feeling good and functioning well. It involves a balance between daily challenges and the resources and skills available to meet them.

Psychological wellbeing can be improved by fostering positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, purpose, and accomplishment. Intentional activities to enhance wellbeing can have long-lasting positive effects.

The publication "Psychological Wellbeing at Sea" offers steps to improve happiness at sea.

###### Steps to Positive Mental Health

Sound Body: Physical health supports emotional well-being. Ensure sufficient sleep, healthy eating, regular exercise, and effective use of rest times. Be mindful of the effects of alcohol, drugs, smoking, and caffeine.

Achieve Things: Achievements boost dopamine and serotonin levels. Set realistic and achievable daily goals, including work, chores, and personal activities.

Connect to Loved Ones: Stay connected with friends and family despite limited communication opportunities. Socialize with crew members and participate in onboard activities such as movie nights or sports

Enjoyable Activities: Engage in enjoyable activities to maintain good mood and energy levels. Balance time alone with social interactions and find hobbies that can be enjoyed onboard.

Step Back: Avoid getting caught up in emotions during problems. Learn to see the bigger picture and respond differently to stressors. The publication "Steps to Positive Mental Health" provides guidance on this.

###### Support

Reederei Nord promotes a supportive culture for mental health and welfare.

Open discussion about mental health is encouraged, and support is available in strict confidence. Crewmembers can seek assistance from team members, heads of departments, or the master.

Masters can seek further help from office staff, following the suggested order: Personnel Officer, Crew Operations Manager, Crewing Director, DPA, and Managing Directors.

####### International Seafarers’ Welfare and Assistance Network (ISWAN)

ISWAN supports seafarers' welfare globally and provides resources on mental health. They offer three brochures with practical recommendations:

- Managing Stress and Sleeping Well at Sea (Ch. 6.27A)

### 3.4.8 Medical Treatment Ashore - rev 0 issued 18.10.2024

##### Medical Treatment Ashore & Hospitalization

Introduction

A crewmember should be sent ashore for medical treatment if they have a serious illness or injury, aren't responding to onboard treatment, require tests like blood or urine, X-rays, or if there's any doubt about their condition.

###### Medical Treatment Ashore & Hospitalization Guidelines:

The Master decides whether a crewmember should be sent ashore for treatment.

Send the crewmember ashore with a completed form (ADM-15 Standard Medical Report Form for Seafarers).

Note: Flag state forms may be required as per Flag legislation

If the crewmember requires hospitalization, the master must contact the vessel’s agent and ensure that proper arrangements are made for them. Advise the agent that the crewmember must receive regular visits and that the company is kept fully informed of his progress.

Inform the personnel department and the local correspondent of the vessel’s P&I club immediately.

Note: If necessary, the personnel department will arrange for a letter of dispensation from the Flag State to enable the vessel to sail with less than the required safe manning.

Sign off the crewmember from the ship's articles. Give them all their documents and final account of wages. Depending on the circumstances, either land their personal effects with them or keep onboard for later forwarding.

Give the crewmember a small amount of cash, about US$ 50.00 (depending on the circumstances), and instruct the agent to seek approval from the personnel department if the crewmember requires further cash.

Once the crewmember is fit to travel the personnel department will decide, in conjunction with the local agent, if he should be repatriated or returned to the vessel.

Send all medical documents and forms by e-mail to the personnel officer immediately.

At the end of each month, prepare a monthly illness report (Form ADM 14) and send it to the personnel department. Only record cases where a crewmember was sent ashore for medical assistance in the report.

### 3.4.9 Vaccinations and Medical Fitness - rev 0 issued 18.10.2024

##### Vaccinations and Medical Fitness

###### Introduction

Every crewmember must be medically fit and have taken the necessary vaccinations to carry out his designated job without endangering or burdening himself and the remainder of the crew.

###### Responsibilities

The personnel department is responsible for ensuring that crewmembers have valid medical certificates, issued in accordance with the STCW Convention, flag state requirements, and the latest applicable ILO/IMO guidelines, upon joining the vessel and throughout their tenure onboard.

The master shall check vaccination certificates of each crewmember joining the vessel and arrange for revaccination and additional vaccinations when the vessel visits ports where the crew will need extra protection. All crewmembers are responsible for keeping a record of their vaccinations.

###### Vaccinations and Medical Fitness Guidelines

The master and crewmembers shall follow the guidelines below:

If a crewmember joins without a valid original medical certificate or if the master suspects the crewmember is unfit to perform duties:

- Inform the personnel department immediately.

- Upon request from the Personnel Department, send the crewmember ashore for a medical examination at the earliest opportunity.

Every crewmember joining a vessel must present to the master a valid original medical certificate in the proper format issued by a medical center for merchant seaman approved by the government of that country.

The company maintains a list of reputable medical practitioners certified by local competent authorities to conduct pre-employment medical examinations of seafarers. The company doctors are selected in consultation with manning agents or P+I Club’s correspondents. The list of company doctors (Form ADM 29) is periodically reviewed.

A medical certificate must be in English or bilingual, in the local language and English, and can be valid for up to two years. This period may be reduced for seafarers over 40 years old. The master must carefully check each certificate and ensure that any conditions imposed are complied with.

Each medical certificate should comply with the latest applicable ILO/IMO guidelines and include information about the seafarer’s satisfactory hearing, sight, and color vision, where applicable. It must also state that the seafarer is not suffering from any medical condition likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the seafarer unfit for such service or to endanger the health of other persons onboard.

The company has introduced a recommended medical certificate form (ADM 30), which meets all the above requirements. The master shall retain all medical certificates and produce them to any port state control inspector or other responsible authorities when requested.

In urgent cases, a seafarer may be allowed by the competent authority to work without a valid medical certificate until the next port of call where they can obtain one, provided that:

- The seafarer possesses a recently expired medical certificate.

- The period of work without a valid medical certificate does not exceed three months from the expiry date of the certificate.

All crewmembers must be vaccinated against yellow fever. The master should ascertain local requirements from the port agent before the vessel calls at a new port. If in doubt, contact the personnel department for advice.

###### Pre-employment Medical Examination

All seafarers scheduled to join Company vessels must undergo a pre-employment medical examination (PEME) according to ILO and STCW standards at licensed medical examination centers approved by the Company (Company Doctors).

The Company runs an Enhanced PEME scheme, requiring each joining seafarer to undergo the following tests in addition to standard medical checks:

- Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m²).

- <18.5: Underweight - It is recommended to gain some weight.

- 18.5 – 24.9: Normal weight.

- 25.0 – 29.9: Pre-obesity - Reasonable steps to reduce BMI recommended.

- 30.0 – 34.9: Obesity Class I - The doctor must confirm medical fitness based on a physical test.

- 35.0+: Time should be allowed to bring the BMI below this value before the seafarer is cleared as fit for service, based on a physical test.

- ECG for seafarers older than 45. If ECG shows any abnormalities, a stress test is required.

- Dental check.

- Lower Abdomen Ultrasound.

Certificates for the above tests, if not already covered by the standard national medical fitness certificate, may be issued in any format but should be in English and clearly readable.

The Company should be informed if a seafarer is issued a conditional medical fitness certificate, indicating any possible condition that may require a special diet, medicines to be taken on board, etc. Generally, seafarers with such certificates would not be allowed to join the vessel; however, each case will be considered individually.

Irrespective of the validity period, a new medical fitness certificate must be obtained before the commencement of each contract by every seafarer. In case of urgent vacancies, when there is insufficient time to obtain a new medical fitness certificate and the existing certificate has sufficient remaining validity to cover the expected contract +3 months, the Company may, at its discretion, accept the seafarer with the current medical fitness certificate.

The costs of Enhanced PEME will be covered by the Company.

Medical certificates should be checked by the manning agent and sent to the Company’s crewing department for document control before any crew joins a vessel.

## 4.1 Navigation Procedures



### 4.1.1 Bridge Team Management - rev 0 issued 24.10.2024

##### Bridge Team Management

###### Introduction

Bridge team management is important:

- For good teamwork

- For team briefing

- For information flow between team members

- To develop skills and confidence of junior members

- For effective external and internal communication

- To identify any developing error chain

- To include pilot as part of bridge team

- To handle the change in communication, command, and control when a pilot takes over navigation of the ship

- For team de-briefing

- Traffic management, particularly in confined waters

- Role of the engine room staff in the team.

- Risk factor in an anticipated operation

Use of English for all communications:

- On the Bridge

- To all remote stations

- With Pilot

Note: The pilot provides translation of communication with Port control or Tugs, if not in English.

###### Responsibility

Master is responsible for building an effective bridge team

All team members are responsible to the master and should fulfil their duties as team members

###### Bridge Team Management Principles

####### Team Building

Encourage bridge team to provide feedback. Allow junior officers to seek clarification of any action of the pilot, master, watch officer when in doubt.

Encourage constructive criticism as useful feedback. Encourage team members to be assertive.

Hold a debriefing to assess the efficiency of the team.

Human error is to be expected and therefore this is to be anticipated.

The bridge team must participate in the navigation of the vessel. One person must not have sole responsibility for the navigation of the vessel.

####### Bridge Disruptions & Distractions

To avoid disruptions of the Bridge team:

- All non-navigational activities on the Bridge shall be restricted or minimized

- Restrict access to any person who has no navigational responsibilities

Note: except in case approved by master

- Restrict use of phones or any other personal electronic device

- Restrict use of the internet except as necessary for navigational purposes (e.g. required updates, licenses and permits to nautical publications, weather information, navigational warnings, etc.)

- Restrict external/internal communications only to the one necessary for safe navigation

####### Assignment of Duties

If more than one person is involved in the navigation of the vessel, then it is essential to agree on the roles and duties of each person.

The Master must keep an overview of the operation of the bridge as a whole and therefore must not allow himself to become involved in any single aspect of the bridge to the detriment of the whole team.

The Master shall:

- Oversee the Bridge Team

- Distribute the responsibilities between team members

- Advise when he takes or relinquish the CON from/to OOW

- Coordinates internal/external communications

- Coordinates engine movements

- Receives feedback from team members and analyse the navigational situation

- Exchange information with Pilot, when under pilotage

The OOW shall:

- Monitor vessel’s position

- Monitor navigational situation including traffic, navigational dangers, external communication

- Take the CON when directed by master

- Receive feedback from other team members and analyse the navigational situation

- Monitor and analyse information from navigational equipment

- Provides navigational feedback to master/pilot

- Demonstrate awareness

- Communicates to master/pilot any concerns immediately

- Maintain a good lookout visually and by using navigational equipment

- Maintain records

Additional Officer (when necessary) shall:

- Assume responsibilities as directed by master

- Provides feedback to master/pilot on navigational or machinery status

- Execute orders received form master/pilot (e.g. operates telegraph, communicates internally/externally, etc…)

- Demonstrate awareness

- Communicates to master/pilot any concerns immediately

- Maintains records

Role of the Helmsman

The Helmsman shall:

- Fully understand the reporting and information required from him.

- Inform the Master or OOW if he experiences any problems with the way the vessel is handling or encounters difficulties with the helm.

- Not be considered to be the lookout while steering.

Role of the Lookout

The lookout shall:

- Be able to give full attention to the keeping of a proper lookout,

- Be competent and diligent in providing necessary information.

- Not be distracted from his primary task and should have binoculars available for use.

- Vary their position on the bridge and bridge wings to ensure they cover all parts of the horizon.

####### The Bridge Team and the Pilot

Navigation under a pilot is probably the most dangerous part of any voyage. The pilot should be integrated into the bridge team as soon as he comes on board.

This is best achieved with a good Master/Pilot exchange highlighting the vessel's characteristics and especially any constraints in her handling or if the vessel is prone to large squat effects.

This exchange must include the handing to the pilot of the prepared ‘Pilot card’. The pilot should be asked if he has any requirements, and within reason these should be extended.

The Master prior to handing over the CON of the vessel must assess the pilot and his situational awareness.

The command of the vessel always remains with the Master, but the Control of Navigation (CON) is passed to the pilot. The CON may be taken back by the ship's staff at any time if there is cause to doubt the pilot's intentions.

The passage plan to the berth must be discussed with the pilot. Should there be a deviation from this plan then the pilot must be asked to clarify and explain the reason or benefit for this change.

Where the pilot sets up his own equipment, for example GPS and AIS, this is to be considered as a secondary system and used by the pilot only as a tool. Navigation and plotting of the ship’s progress must always be done with the ship’s own equipment.

####### Communications

Communications could be a distraction to the monitoring of the vessel such as VHF, internal telephone communication etc.

Communication shall be:

- Carried out by a designated member of the team.

- Effective

Ensure all BT members understand and make positive feedback relating to the passage, noting positions of Navigational Marks, other vessels and concerns of collision avoidance.

Encourage BT members to voice their concerns in doubt.

Note: disagreement should not be seen as criticism of a person's ability, but that a human error could be made. When a doubt is raised the team should assess the impact of this on the passage.

####### Leadership

The Master should:

- Motivate the team. Discuss with the team at the planning and operational level

Note:	Personnel who are fully involved will be better able to support and inform the Master during the execution of the passage.

- Keep overall control. Train the team members to provide support when required

####### Assessing and Managing Risk

Every passage involves a certain amount of risk

- Internal risks due to equipment failure or human error

- External risks such as the actions of other vessels or weather conditions

Identifying risks is one of the main aims of bridge team management. Plans should be made to reduce and manage those risks. Assumptions should not be made and procedures should be followed.

Prepare a proper assessment of the passage and clarify any assumptions prior to continuing the passage.

An error chain is a series of events that lead to an accident. Each individual link may seem insignificant. In principle if the chain can be broken at any stage then in most cases an accident will be avoided.

When signs of an existence of an error chain are noted:

- Breaking the chain is done through communication.

- Anyone noting the presence or start of a chain should voice his concerns to the others

- The whole team should assess the situation and take remedial action

- Ensure the vessel continues to be navigated safely.

- Concerns raised should be dealt with and not ignored

Situational Awareness is the ability to have an accurate perception of the factors and conditions that affect the ship and the bridge team during a specific period.

- Ability to recognise the warning signs of an error chain

- Being able to break the chain before an accident occurs.

Any of the following items are indications of situation awareness being lost and that an error chain may develop or exists

- Ambiguity

- Breakdown in communications

- Confusion

- Distraction

- Established rules are not followed

- Failure to adhere to the passage plan

- Keeping a poor lookout

##### Minimum Bridge Manning Levels

Master shall decide the bridge manning level in accordance with below requirements:

###### Definitions:

- X – Required

- O – Optional at Master’s discretion

- M – Manned E/R

- U – Unmanned E/R

- A – Autopilot at Master’s or OOW discretion

- (*) – Additional Officer at Master’s discretion

- (**) – Master can be replaced by C/O

###### Watch levels

      - Note:	 Master can deviate from above requirements for safety considerations, based on a Risk Assessment

###### Bridge Team Duties

      - Note:	(*) Watch Condition 1-The OOW may function as sole watch keeper during daylight.
Watch Condition 2- The second AB/OS shall be available on call.

      - (**) Master can decide if the AB/OS presence is required continuously or be ready on a short call. Appropriate records must be maintained (reason for decision if “on call”)

      - Note:	OTHER DUTIES may include logbook keeping, equipment checks and tending the engine order telegraph.

      - Overlap among bridge team members indicates duties that may be shared.

      - When a cadet is on board, we may use them to supplement other members of the team.

##### Master's Bridge Standing Orders

##### Bridge Watch-Keeping

###### Introduction

Bridge watch-keeping is the most important activity on board a ship at sea. The safety of life and the vessel takes precedence over all other considerations. No schedule, convenience, or previous instructions justify taking risks that may endanger human life or the ship.

The master decides the composition of the bridge team based on:

Workload and experience of officers

Weather

Time of day

Traffic density

Difficult conditions (e.g., ice)

Specific geographical areas

Sudden unplanned manoeuvres for SAR, sighting refugees, etc.

Transit through piracy waters or hostile areas

Compliance with STCW code, ILO, and MLC conventions regarding minimum rest periods

The master forms part of the watch-keeping team when needed

The master reassesses the bridge team composition whenever conditions change

###### Responsibilities

The master, OOW, and bridge team members are responsible for safe watch-keeping.

Complete form NAV 01 – “Familiarization with Bridge Equipment” before taking over your first watch at sea.

The 2nd officer prepares a risk assessment and discusses it with the master to identify the recommended bridge manning level based on onboard conditions and geographical areas.

Arrange suitable watches so bridge team members are well-rested.

Comply with STCW, MLC, and local requirements (such as OPA 90).

The master should use their overriding authority to delay or postpone any operation, including vessel departure or arrival, to:

##### Main Engine Bridge Control Alarms and Solutions

###### Introduction

As per US 33 Code of Federal Regulations 165.810 for regulated navigation areas, ship’s officers should know how to override load-limiting programs or automatic acceleration-limiting programs of the main engine.

###### Responsibility

Officers should be aware of the following functions normally found at the bridge control alarm panel and know how and when to use the override functions. Ship’s masters should train their officers in using these functions.

###### Alarms

START FAILURE

During the start of main engines, if the failure alarm indicates START FAILURE, reset the telegraph to the stop position and wait for instructions from the engine room.

LOAD UP PROGRAM

Designed to prevent any abrupt load increase on the main engine (temperature rise or mechanical stress) and gradually increase the speed in steps. Pushing Load Program Cancel allows the main engine speed to increase rapidly.

LOAD DOWN PROGRAM

Designed to slowly decrease the main engine running speed. Pushing Load Program Cancel allows the main engine to decrease rapidly.

SPEED LIMITING

The main engine speed will not exceed the limit set in the engine room. If necessary for the safety of navigation, request the engine room to change the limit.

AUTO-SLOW DOWN

When the Engine Protection System issues an Auto Slow-down Signal, the maximum allowable main engine running speed is limited to the auto slow down level.

CRASH REVERSING

Operating the main engine telegraph against the actual main engine running direction, while the main engine is still running at the speed for crash reversing or above, will cause reversing of the main engine in steps.

##### Phone Use on Bridge

Introduction Uncontrolled use of mobile phones during critical navigation conditions distracts the bridge team from watch-keeping duties and can cause accidents.

Phone Use on Bridge Guidance

Create red zones where navigation requires undivided attention of all bridge team members.

Designate the following areas as “RED ZONES”:

Areas of high traffic density

Conditions of restricted visibility

Vicinity of offshore installations and other structures

Approaches to ports, harbours, anchorages, or in pilotage waters

Mark the red zone on ENC/chart using manual correction.

All personnel on the bridge shall follow this policy.

Prohibit the use of mobile or satellite phones on the bridge in red zones.



### 4.1.2 UKC and OH Procedure - rev 0 issued 24.10.2024

##### Under Keel Clearance

###### Purpose

This policy gives guidance for minimum UKC calculation for safe navigation.

Nothing in these guidelines shall prejudice the rights of shipmasters to act accordingly in the distress and emergency situations or any other extenuating circumstances to ensure the safety of life at sea, safety of the vessel and protection of environment.

###### Responsibilities

Master

Safe navigation of the vessel and maintaining under keel clearance (UKC) as per company UKC policy.

Consider information received from:

- Local authorities and other regulatory bodies

- Company

- Charterers

- Agents

Inform the marine superintendent of your vessel when:

- Company UKC policy cannot be complied with

Inform the DPA when:

- Master considers the expected UKC to be unsafe.

Navigating Officers

Comply with company UKC policy and master’s UKC instructions.

You may use estimated times for UKC calculations during the passage planning stage.

Update UKC calculations when actual transit times are available.

###### Instructions for UKC

The master and navigating officers shall comply with below instructions.

Estimate the minimum UKC along the transit route, including the port facility or anchorage.

If voyage orders specify a draught or cargo nomination that will result in a lesser UKC than the required in this procedure, notify the:

- DPA

- Marine superintendent

Make a risk assessment and send it to the Office for review. Apply due diligence, consider contractual obligations under:

- Voyage orders

- Cargo nominations

Note:	Local regulations or rules by controlling authorities may authorise such voyage orders or nominations.

Note: For the Bulk Carriers, if the Charter Party contains the NAABSA Clause (NOT ALWAYS AFLOAT BUT SAFE AGROUND) and the ship is requested to take the ground while alongside, the Master shall inform the Office well in advance to discuss the safety implications.

Re-do the UKC calculations in case there are changes of:

- Cargo nomination

- Berth

- Berthing time

Calculate the draught of the vessel after checking:

- Water density

- Sag

- List

- Heel

Consider if the vessel is crossing lock or dock sills.

Consider if vessels of similar build, size, draft and speed have already made the transit safely under prevailing environmental conditions.

Obtain from the local authorities or terminals before arrival:

- The latest depth chart

- Information for the berth

- The nature of the sea bottom

Consider scheduling the berthing at discharge ports and un-berth at load ports at the time of high water, if required, for UKC compliance.

Consider starting cargo operations before low water at discharge ports for UKC compliance.

Consider vacating the berth in case of risk of grounding.

Keep all relevant parties informed of the situation.

Make squat allowance for:

- Anticipated speed through the water

- Vessel’s movement in open seaway

In calm sheltered waters, reduce speed to minimize effect of squat.

Present UKC calculations to pilot along with the passage plan.

Discuss transits through shallow areas in detail:

- Consider dynamic UKC

If you suspect the vessel has touched bottom:

- Inform the pilot (when applicable)

- Make appropriate logbook entries including:

      - Date

      - Time

      - Position

- Notify the company.

- Investigate for damage as per relevant shipboard procedures.

##### UKC Policy

Master and all officers in-charge of a navigational watch must comply with below policy.

###### UKC Guidance

####### UKC alongside berth

- Comply with UKC policy – 1)

- Take hand lead soundings and echo-sounder data, around the vessel to confirm the depth alongside (unless master determines by other means that sufficient / safe UKC above the company minimum UKC limits is available)

Note:	 Consider effects of current on UKC for berths situated on rivers or in areas affected by tidal currents.

####### Waters within port limits, Safety Fairways, Rivers, Channels, Canals, Anchorages (with high reliability of water depth information)

Note: This shall mean those areas that are generally within the port limits and are actively managed by authorities (including dredging), which includes Fairways, Rivers, Channels and Canals.

- Comply with UKC policy – 2)

- Test echo sounder on all ranges before departure/arrival at port (when required)

- Keep echo sounder recording when vessel is underway

- Set the echo sounder alarm above the minimum UKC for the area

####### UKC in waters outside port limits with depth less than 50 meters and SBM / CBM

Note: This shall mean shallow waters outside port limits, including at SBM / CBM.

- Comply with UKC policy – 3)

    - Caution: If the master is in doubt whether the area of navigation falls under policy (2) or (3), the higher UKC will apply.

- Keep echo sounder recording when vessel is underway

- Set the echo sounder alarm value above the minimum UKC for the area

####### UKC in Open waters - depth of water > 50 meters

- Comply with UKC policy – 4)

- Maintain echo sounder switched on for depths less than 100 meters (recording is not necessary)

####### UKC in US & ports and approaches where max safe draft applies

In port areas where the relevant Authority manages channel navigation and terminal limitations based upon a declared “safe draft”, rather than indicating depth and required UKC, the Authority declared safe draft may be followed where there is clear precedent of similar sized vessels safely navigating the channel in numerous transits under similar conditions, and that the passage is conducted under Authority Pilotage.

Note: In some ports and their approaches, depths obtained from charts are not available/reliable, hence an accurate UKC calculation cannot be conducted. Each time the vessel calls such a port the master should obtain the latest official depth information from the Agent/Authorities.

Master shall conduct a Risk Assessment considering local official information including the historical data from similar size vessels with similar arrival/departure drafts under similar environmental conditions operated in the area.

      - Note:   In addition, the master shall approach the Office and may obtain information from own fleet.

The UKC shall be calculated based on charted depth, with and without applying CATZOC allowance, for reference only as a requirement of the master’s Risk Assessment.

Note:   If residual risk of the master’s Risk Assessment is within company accepted limits, at ports where local authorities declare a maximum safe draft, such as US ports, master may proceed on the passage provided that maximum safe draft declared by the local authorities is not exceeded by the vessel.

####### Local UKC Requirement

In addition to company UKC requirements, maintain minimum under-keel clearance required by:

- Governments

- Port authorities

- Pilot organisations

If local regulations require a UKC that is less than the one stipulated in Company’s UKC policy, inform the DPA or marine superintendent, before transiting the subject area.

####### UKC in Pilotage Waters

Discuss the below with the pilot:

- Ship’s draft

- Controlling depth of the port transit

- Anticipated under-keel clearance

- Transit speed

- Squat effect

- Shoals

- Turn bearings

- Anticipated effect of weather and sea

Note:	Consult the pilot for any additional information that may affect the controlling depth of the port transit

####### Guidance for UKC of Deep Draft Vessels in Malacca and Singapore Strait

###### Purpose

- Use the guidelines, especially on-board deep draft ships, to plan a safe passage through the Malacca and Singapore straits

- Consult the following publications when proceeding through the straits of Malacca and Singapore

- NP44 Chapter 2 – Malacca Strait and Singapore Strait – Through Routing

- BA5524 & BA 5525 – Mariner’s routing guide to Malacca and Singapore Straits

- Straits of Malacca and Singapore – A Guide to planned transits by deep draft vessels

- Pre-plan the passage from One Fathom Bank (OFB), Batu Berhanti to Eastern bank

- Follow the tidal surge to use the maximum depth of water for transit

- Adjust the time of arrival at OFB so that there is sufficient water in the strait to make a non-stop passage all the way to eastern bank

- Adjust speed to pass the staging points at the earliest pre-arranged time

- Discuss the commercial constraints imposed by the above speed adjustment with charterers/pool manager

Note: Do this in advance of loading and after the voyage instruction has been received

- Plan a range of cargo intakes

- Advise the charterer/pool manager of:

- The resulting drafts

- Any expected waiting time at OFB

Note:	This range of cargo intakes should be from the maximum intake without any delay in transit to the requested intake draft.

- If the planned transit occurs during neap tides when delays of several days awaiting suitable tides may occur, inform the charterers/pool managers before arrival at the loading port

Note:		We exclude the straits transit from the warranted speed and performance of the vessel in performance reports and voyage logs

- Follow the guidance given in:

- “UKC for deep draft vessels in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore”

- Company’s UKC Policy

- Keep the echo sounder switched on and recording when vessel is under way

- Set the echo sounder alarm to a value in excess of the minimum UKC for the area.

##### Explanation of Squat, Trim and UKC.

###### Guidance for UKC Corrections

Master and navigating officers must use below guidelines to obtain accurate UKC.

- Estimate the sea depth by correcting the charted depth using correction value

Note:	We base the correction value on tide calculations (on tidal waters) or changes to the Mean Sea Level (areas with no tides).

- Obtain the relevant data through information found in:

- The Coast Pilot

- Local Notice to Marines

- Navigational and Hydro-meteorological Warnings

- Obtained from Port Authorities via Agents

- Estimate the UKC considering:

- Influence of vessel’s draft on hogging or sagging

- The vessels size and maneuvering characteristics

- Decrease in draft due to fuel and freshwater consumption

- Increase in draft due to vessels:

- Trim

- Roll

- Pitch

- Heave

- Squat

- Variation in draft due to density of sea water

- Reliability of Ship’s drafts observations

- Accuracy of:

- Predicted tide height

- Measured tide height

- Mean Sea Level

- Declared charted depth

- Allowance for possible siltation since last survey

- Nature and stability of seabed

- Reduced depth over pipelines

- Correction for the reliability of data (CATZOC)

- Determine the under-keel clearance (UKC) as sum of:

- Minimal navigation clearance

- Correction due to:

- The sea state conditions

- The ship’s squat

- Heave

- Trim

- List

- Pitch

- Roll

Note: Ship's corrected navigational draft (i.e. after considering squat, environmental conditions, hog/sag, changes in water density, etc.) should be less than, or maximum equal to, the difference between the corrected sea depth and the required UKC

Formula for estimated draft increase due to list and values for various sizes of vessels:

Di= Vessel’s Beam / 2xsin (list angle)

Formula for estimated draft increase due to pitch and values for various sizes of vessels:

Di = Vessel’s Length / 2xsin (pitch angle)

###### Form for UKC Calculations

- Use the form generated by software to calculate the UKC

- Set up the Company UKC Policy in the lower part of below screenshot

- Select the option ‘actual value in meters’

The below image shows the header of the Squat / UKC Calculation form contained in DNV Navigator software.

###### DNV Navigator UKC calculation reference

- Enter correct data to generate good results using the software (using Barra’s formulae).

- When entering data into the calculation form observe the below facts to have a more accurate result.

- Change in water depth due to:

###### Reliability of Data

When calculating SD or UKC, consider CATZOC corrections as follows:

- For areas, channels and canals where the depth is maintained do not apply correction for CATZOC. Use the maintained depth value for UKC calculations

- For areas where a minimum depth value is available in the pick report under “Depths - (DRVAL1)” do not apply the CATZOC correction. Use this value for UKC calculations (see NP 231 ed 2016, page 84)

For areas where depths are not maintained or a minimum depth value is not available in the pick report, apply the CATZOC correction to the water depth from the chart.

Note:	Subtract all above changes from the charted depth. The height of tide is usually positive.

- Change in draft due to:

Note:		Add all above to the static draft.

- Enter the width of channel transited correctly.

Note:	 This will make the difference between “open” or “confined” waters

- Find information regarding channel width from:

- Guide to Port Entry

- From Agent

Note:	If the above information is not available, master must use discretion, considering available information.

Barras formula

This formula provides more realistic values by giving error on the safe side (i.e. is giving bigger values).

                - Where:

                - CB = Block Coefficient

                - V = Ship speed in knots relative to the water (including the action of current)

          - S2 = AS/AW  - Velocity return factor (is the ratio between the ship’s cross-sectional area AS and the net cross-sectional area of the waterway AW )

  - Use software for UKC calculations required for Passage Planning.

Squat facts

- Ship on even keel and CB = 0.7 – Ship is squatting with no change of trim

- Ship on even keel and CB > 0.7 – Ship is squatting and trimming to forward

- Ship on even keel and CB < 0.7 – Ship is squatting and trimming to aft

- Ship with existing trim to aft – Ship is squatting with trim to aft

- Ship with existing trim to forward – Ship is squatting with trim to forward

- Squat varies directly with the breadth – doubling breadth doubles squat

- Squat varies doubles by the square of speed – doubling the sped quadruples the squat

- Squat can be doubled when meeting another vessel

Caution: Squat may become critical where a channel width of less than 5 times the beam of the ship is combined with a static under keel clearance of less than 20% of the vessel’s draft.

- The factors that govern the amount of squat are:

- The speed of the vessel through the water

- The block coefficient of the vessel (CB)

- The ratio of draught to depth of water

- Steaming in shallow and restricted or unrestricted waters

How to recognize whether / when Squat occurs?

- If a vessel reaches shallow waters and feels the ground, you will observe:

- Wave pattern changes at the stern and the bow of the vessel

- The vessel becomes dull when carrying out maneuvers

- The revolution of main engine decreases, in restricted waters more obviously than in unrestricted waters

- The vessels speed decreases, in restricted waters more obviously than in wide unrestricted waters

- Appreciable vibrations of the ship’s hull occur

Note:	The only effective measure by the ship’s command to reduce or eliminate squatting is the immediate reduction of speed.

- Squat-values changes about the square of the ship’s speed through the water. By reducing the speed through the water by about a half, the squat reduces to about a quarter.

##### MINIMUM OVERHEAD CLEARANCE

###### Definitions

- Refer to the Mariners Handbook NP 100 for detailed definitions.

- Overhead clearance is the clearance between the highest point of a vessel and the obstruction.

- Air draught is the distance from the surface of the water to the highest point on a vessel.

- Vertical clearance is the minimum height of the underside of the span of a bridge, or an overhead cable.

Minimum Overhead Clearance Procedure

The master and navigating officers shall follow this procedure

Prepare a table showing air draughts corresponding to water depths.

Allow for trim when calculating the air draught at any position between the forward and after perpendiculars.

If navigating on the rivers, allow for river gauge correction of the water level (if any) when calculating overhead clearance.

Air draught and OHC values should take into account the datum and not assume that the vertical datum is that used for the rest of the ENC.

Allow for tides when calculating OHC.

Keep a minimum overhead clearance of 1 meter when passing under bridges or overhead cables.

If unable to comply with OHC requirements due to cargo nomination or voyage orders, inform DPA or marine superintendent.

Discuss the commercial constraints with charterers/pool managers well in advance of loading and after the voyage instruction has been received.

Use form NAV 21 to assist with calculation.

### 4.1.3 Passage Planning and Execution - rev 0 issued 24.10.2024

##### Passage Plan

###### Definitions

Route is a series of waypoints connected by one or more legs including both straight and curved segments

Voyage is a set of information and data for a passage from A to B. A voyage may consist of more than one route and includes information like reporting and reference points, checklists, underkeel/overhead clearance, nautical information, schedule, etc.

###### Introduction

Passage planning consists of four key stages: appraisal, planning, execution, and monitoring.

These stages are specified in International Maritime Organization Resolution A. 893(21), “Guidelines for Voyage Planning”, which are, in turn, reflected in the local laws of IMO signatory countries.

Every passage a vessel undertakes must be properly planned. The objective of passage planning is to achieve a safe and economical passage from port to port.

Plan passages from berth to berth.

Vessels shall:

- Ensure that:

- Primary and secondary ECDIS are provided with route planning & monitoring capabilities

- Required ENCs (official) available for intended passage.

- Keeps ENCs corrected/updated up to the latest notice to mariners.

- Upload the ENCs required on Navigational tablet (if provided) to be ready for use in case of emergency (i.e. both ECDIS units failure)

Schematically, voyage planning stages on ECDIS are as follows:

Before departure the master shall hold a meeting and brief the deck officers and the chief engineer on the passage plan.

Note:	An effective briefing involves the participation of all, and officers should feel free to make suggestions, share best practice and raise any concerns for discussion and potential modifications to the passage plan. Discuss the plan in detail and all should understand it.

  - If amending a plan on passage due to changes in circumstances or conditions:

Plan and review the changes in the same manner as the original plan.

The bridge team should review the revised plan and sign it again to demonstrate their agreement with the revisions.

Record the changes after making appropriate entry of the reasons for the change.

In case of destination change where the whole plan needs to be changed, the old passage plan should be filed in the Passage Plan file for further reference.

Watch officers and chief engineer should acknowledge their understanding of the new passage plan.

Record the meeting in the logbook.

###### Responsibilities

The master has overall responsibility for the safe navigation of the vessel and must approve the passage plan before departure from port.

Passage planning on ECDIS

Use information obtained from your appraisal to create the safest route and navigation plan.

Create a new route in ECDIS, as given below:

Unload any:

- Old routes

- User created maps

Set the default voyage settings in ECDIS, as given below:

Data selection corridor

Note:	Set the width of the corridor in such a way to include ENCs in the vicinity of the route, that may be used in case a large deviation from the original route would be required during the passage.

Set the value for “F distance” in the Configuration Menu

Note: 	For F-distance set up procedure see Navigation procedures 12.8 Equipment – Use of ECDIS for Navigation – Wheel over Line Settings

Set UKC Settings in accordance with company Under Keel Clearance policy:

  - UKC will be calculated for each route leg by using the following formula:

  - UKC = (T – W – SF + t – d – L) – (D + S)

  - Where:

        - D - Static draught (set by the user);

        - d - Possible change of draught due to the change of water density.

        - L -list and heel. Ship listing angle is considered when calculating the max ship draught. Taken from tables for different heeling angles.

        - S - Squat - calculated by software.

        - SF - Safety factors considering: CATZOC, nature of the bottom, siltation allowance and draught tolerances.

        - t - Allowance for the tide based on a local variation; tidal tables (taken from Tide database).

        - T - Water depth at chart datum.

        - W - Wave response allowance; depending on the current or possible swell conditions (estimated by Master).

Consider planning great circle or composite great circle tracks, to save time/ fuel but having due regard to adverse weather, local navigation restrictions (e.g. Aleutian Islands, etc…) or ice that may be encountered on these routes

Create a new “rough” route / waypoints on ECDIS planning station for the intended voyage using general ENC available in the system.

Note:	Ships can make use of available weather routing or voyage optimization services for this stage of the passage planning.

Set initial route information

Route name

Note:	Route name should be created in the following manner “Departure port name - Arrival port name, followed by the voyage number” e.g. (Bilbao – Rotterdam 202003B)

Ship’s draft

Ship’s particulars

Voyage particulars

Install required ENCs, ADPs and AENPs for the intended route

Update the chart catalogue on ECDIS

Update all ENCs for the voyage

Note: Manually set route corridor to 25 miles on either side of course line to select ENCs that would allow for deviation, if required.

Fine Tune (Edit) the route using largest scale ENCs, as required by those parameters that were not considered during the creation of new “rough” route:

Ensure the route is passing clear of:

- Obstructions

- Dangers to navigation

- Prohibited areas

- Other restricted areas

In the Remarks column enter information for each leg regarding:

Position cross-check frequency and methods

E/R machinery status

Bridge manning level requirements

Minimum UKC values for the shallowest points along the route

Note:	Information entered in the “Remarks column” is continuously displayed below the “Leg” information.

Set values for each waypoint / leg for:

- Safety depth (SD)

Note:	Calculate safety depth using formula: SD = draught + squat + effect of environmental and other conditions + UKC policy - HoT (height of tide). (See Navigation procedures 12.8 Equipment – ECDIS Safety Functions).

Safety contour (SC)

Note:	Set the Safety Contour to the same value as the Safety Depth.

Turning radius for each waypoint (R)

- Cross-track limits (XTD), considering the area of navigation

Note: 	Calculate the turning radius using formula: R = (Speed / ROT) x 0.96

Note: 	When navigating on TSS or Fairways, the XTD should cover the entire width of the traffic lane (use as many intermediate waypoints as necessary)

Ship’s draft

Expected UKC (manually calculated)

Note: 	Calculate the UKC by the formula: UKC = water depth – draught – Squat + HoT. Introduce this value in the “UKC” column in the waypoint list. Select the shallowest depth between the waypoints as the “water depth”. Where the UKC is more than 50 meters just record UKC > 50m in the column.

Ship’s air draft

Overhead clearance, where applicable (manually calculated)

Create a route schedule

Insert manually:

The departure date and time from the first waypoint

The time zone for each waypoint

The intended transit speed between waypoints or ETA for the end point

Calculate the schedule using the system’s built-in function

Check the route using system’s built-in function and make necessary adjustments:

Each alarm or warning should be examined for safety individually

Caution: 	A route should be validated in the ECDIS before it is set for monitoring.

Conduct a second independent check at compilation scale (1:1 scale) across all legs to confirm the route and XTD are clear of potential danger.

Note: during the route check, in confined waters, on TSS and fairways set the XTD in such a way to cover the entire width of the navigable channel; the reason is to ensure that area is safe in case a deviation is required due to traffic in the lanes (use as many intermediate waypoints as necessary).

Create additional layers on ECDIS using “Maps” function containing:

Locations to report to shore traffic services

Locations to call the master/ EOOW

Locations to change machinery status

Locations where to call the master

Contingency anchorages

Abort positions

Safe speed and necessary speed alterations

Points of no return

Parallel indexes

Transits, heading marks and leading lines

Clearing lines and bearings

Clearing ranges (radar)

Highlighted radar-conspicuous objects used for position fixing

Highlighted racons used for position fixing

Bridge manning level requirements / changes

Position cross-check frequency and methods

Minimum UKC values for the shallowest points along the route

Overhead clearance when passing under bridges, power lines or cable cars

Information related to traffic density

Information related to areas affected by strong currents or tides

Areas to avoid (no-go areas)

Locations where echo sounder must be set to recording mode

LDL (limiting danger lines), if any

Other important information

Note: Use only fixed reference marks and landmarks

Caution: 	Do not use floating objects for parallel indexing or position plotting (buoys, etc.)

Plot on the ENC:

NavArea / Navigational warnings received via Sat-C or other software affecting the area of navigation (i.e. in the vicinity of the route) and presenting a danger to navigation, even if Nav Warnings are received automatically on ECDIS

Navtex warnings for the area of navigation, if Navtex is not connected to ECDIS

Navtex warnings affecting the area along the route that may pose a danger to navigation, even if Navtex is connected to ECDIS

T&P notices if vessel is not provided with AIO (Admiralty Information Overlay) service

T&P notices affecting the area of navigation along the route and posing a danger to navigation, even if an AIO is provided (because AIO provides a polygon with the affected area only)

Any other navigational warnings received from other official sources, such as information provided by Port Authorities, Agents, etc.

Record any manual correction in ECDIS 04 – Manual Correction Log

Approve the voyage by pressing the “Approve button”.

Note:	If the “Approve button” is pressed, it means confirmation of the order and saving of the route to the internal database, where the route can be used in the ECDIS task.

Follow the procedure for Passage plan development given above.

Chart (ENC) Selection

All vessels in the fleet are enrolled in an agreement with a ENC supplier for handling the ENC permits and updates

- ECDIS Planning Tool is used for management, updating and licensing of ENCs.

- Each vessel is using a hardware supplied by the service provider to connect the ECDIS online with supplier’s servers

- The online connection provides access to below services:

- Pre - licensing of ENCs

- Weekly ENC updates

- Supply of new ENCs or new edition ENCs

- Supply of AIO updates

- Supply of navigational warnings, etc.

Caution: if the vessel is not trading in a specific Navarea for a longer period (more than a month), request the MSI to provide the full list of warnings in force upon entering this area; the reason is that older warnings still in force will not be re-broadcasted

Note:	As a back-up, above services are also available via e-mail

####### Navigation in Coastal Areas

Definition: Coastal waters apply within 12 miles of shore.

Responsibility:

2nd Officer: Plan passage using ECDIS

Master: Shall approve plan

OOW: Conduct safe navigation.

The OOW shall follow these guidelines:

Keep a maximum safe distance from shore considering:

Wind

Current

Risk of steering or engine failure

Reduced propulsion power

Traffic density

Use GNSS as the primary source of positional information. In case of GNSS failure, use:

Visual fixing (three-point visual compass fix with good landmarks, if available)

Radar fixing (three-range fix with good radar targets or three-point bearings, if available)

Echo sounder to monitor changes in water depth

Dead reckoning

Use radar parallel index techniques whenever possible. Be aware of the limitations and errors of electronic navigation aids.

Take bearings frequently and use more than one position fixing method when possible.

Identify navigation marks and confirm GNSS positions in ECDIS using traditional fixing methods, such as visual and radar fixes.

During restricted visibility, use ECDIS together with a dedicated radar display.

Use the echo sounder to compare the depth obtained with the chart, allowing for:

Predicted tidal height

Draft

Switch the echo sounder to ‘Record’ mode in depths less than 50 meters if it does not record continuously.

Follow IMO traffic separation schemes, when available. Avoid crossings between schemes that may hamper other traffic and increase the risk of collision.

Leave room for potential course alterations due to other traffic when passing islands and shoals.

Avoid sea areas that present dangers such as:

Shallow depth

Shoals

Narrow passages

Dense traffic

Confused traffic (local boats, fishing vessels)

Strong current

Poor visibility (sandstorms, smoke)

Ice blockage

Unreliable chart data

Piracy

Verify the passage plan for:

Tracks and courses marked in 360° notation

Note: Repeat celestial fixes at sufficient intervals to maintain knowledge, especially on ships with a sextant

####### Navigation in Narrow Channels, Waters, and Straits

Definition: Narrow waters are those where safe navigation is restricted due to geographical obstructions, shallow depth, or vessel traffic density.

Introduction: Plan passage through restricted waters with care. The OOW is responsible for safe conduct and should remain vigilant during transit.

Navigation in Narrow Waters and Straits Guidelines:

2nd Officer should plan the passage while OOW must follow these guidelines.

Mark conspicuous objects for radar and terrestrial bearings on the chart.

Identify contingency anchorages to enable anchoring clear of the main route in case of restricted visibility or other unexpected circumstances.

Be alert during navigation, with or without a pilot on board. Follow strict bridge watch-keeping procedures.

Prohibit casual visits to the bridge and reduce conversation to that necessary for proper running of the vessel.

The master should be on the bridge, and the helmsman should monitor the course.

Verify all procedures and arrangements before entering narrow waters and straits.

Follow international regulations for preventing collisions at sea.

Check items as per form NAV 17 and record them in the bridge logbook.

Note: Use only qualified helmsmen in narrow waters and straits.

Navigate large vessels in the greatest available depth of water. Follow recommended routes and planned speed.

Keep the vessel on an even keel in areas of restricted depths. Use sufficient generators in confined waters to prevent a blackout.

Continuously check water depth using the echo sounder and plot the vessel’s position frequently on the largest scale charts.

Note: This will instantly call attention to deviations from the planned track.

Verify fixes by more than one method where possible. Use radar and other navigational aids even in clear weather.

Assign a navigating officer to keep check on the vessel's position.

The chief engineer and another engineer shall man the engine room during maneuvering. Engineers shall remain until machinery parameters stabilize.

The master and chief engineer shall assess the need for engine room manning at key points in the passage, considering the prevention of power loss and other technical failures.

Note: Man the engine room during emergency and training drills.

Arrange bridge and engine room watches to avoid fatigue during long passages in narrow waters.

Squat facts

####### Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS)

Introduction: TSS is a routing measure aimed at separating opposing streams of traffic by appropriate means and establishing traffic routes.

Transit through TSS Guidance:

Follow established traffic separation and routing schemes.

Follow the designated general direction of the traffic.

Comply with COLREGS provisions, particularly Rule 10.

Comply with local reporting requirements.

Allow an adequate margin of safety.

Call the master if traffic movement causes concern.

When joining or leaving a TSS, comply with Colreg’s Rule 10, Point b, item iii.

Follow rules concerning proper lookout, safe speed, risk of collision, and action to avoid collision.

When required to cross a TSS, select a location with sufficient depth of water and margin to maneuver.

Plot all traffic in the vicinity using radar and ARPA.

Adjust speed until a safe crossing opportunity occurs.

Inform VTS (if applicable) of crossing intentions.

Display appropriate signals/shapes/lights as required by local regulations.

Cross as close as possible at right angles to the scheme’s alignment.

Note: There is no right of way in a traffic separation lane. If risk of collision exists, follow steering and sailing rules. Be aware that fishing vessels are allowed to fish in traffic separation lanes.

####### Navigation on River

Responsibilities:

Master and 2nd Officer: Prepare the passage plan, obtain recent information on river depths and strong currents from agents and local authorities, and include the pilot in planning when possible. Review the passage plan and remain responsible for the vessel while under the pilot’s advice.

Second Officer: Prepare the passage plan in consultation with the master, using information on river depths and currents, and calculate wheel-over positions.

OOW: Follow the passage plan.

On long river passages, primarily conducted at full speed, assess the necessity of keeping the forecastle manned, considering local regulations.

River Navigation Guidance: The master & OOW should discuss the passage plan with the pilot and amend if required. The master and OOW are responsible for vessel’s conduct in the river.

####### Additional Guidelines

The below guidelines are in addition to standard company navigational guidance including guidance given for narrow waters and straits. These provide guidance when the river is running “high “with strong currents downriver.

Plan the passage addressing the unique challenges presented by high water conditions, specific to the vessel’s intended route, possible anchorage areas and the dock facility to visit.

Consider the following factors:

- Experience of the personnel concerned

- Reliability of aids to navigation and alternate position fixing aids

- Large floating debris, underwater shoreline obstructions, uncontrolled drifting barges

- Higher current velocities affecting vessel while maneuvering (especially down river), moored or at anchor

- Upstream eddies that are not present at lower water levels

- Possible shoaling due to increased water flow

- Speed restrictions, if applicable, in certain stretches of the river

- Due to extended passage time, plan rest hours for personnel

- Higher water levels impacting air drafts of overhead obstructions such as bridges, power lines etc.

- Number of tugs required to safely moor or unmoor vessel and while alongside berth

- Assess challenge of turning downstream of docks and when maneuvering in anchorages

Exchange information with the pilot regarding:

Maximum drafts and air drafts

Minimum UKC & overhead clearance

Maximum speed

Critical locations and action required (bars, narrow passages, heavy traffic, bends etc.)

Notice required for changes in machinery status

Notice required for making fast tugs

Environmental conditions

Expected weather

Abnormal navigation conditions

Tug push location

Safe bollards pull load for tugs

Regard the pilot as an advisor, even though they have local experience and skills in ship handling. If uncertain regarding pilot’s intentions, seek clarification.

Concentrate on the job at hand. Do not be distracted by phone calls or any other disturbance. 
If possible, respond to the call but only to inform the calling party that you are busy with critical navigation and will revert later.

  - Caution! Remain alert when negotiating sharp bends when the ship is sailing down river (with following current). Pay attention to speed and the reserve engine power that may be necessary to use in order to turn the ship around the bend.

      - Note:	The ship’s speed over ground can be rather high if not controlled properly and the ship’s maneuvering response may be sluggish.

      - Note:	Late start of turning may result in impossibility to overcome the effect of strong current once inside the bends, resulting in the vessel being thrown off course.

Be aware of the functions available on bridge control panel, including the limit over-ride function (by-pass) to get reserve power rapidly in case of emergency.

####### Wave Wash Effect

Introduction: Wave wash refers to the erosive action on shores or embankments, damage to anchored, moored, or passing vessels, injuries to people, and damage to third-party assets caused by lapping or breaking waves. This effect can occur due to increased vessel speed in narrow channels.

Guidance to Avoid Wave Wash Effect:

Be cautious when navigating in narrow waters.

Discuss the wave wash effect in detail with the pilot during the master's/pilot passage plan information exchange procedure.

Evaluate and adjust the vessel's speed accordingly.

####### Navigation in Oil-Field Development Areas

Introduction

Oil-field development areas may contain uncharted and unlit buoys, structures, drilling rigs, pipelines, and wellheads on the seabed. Safety zones may be established up to 500 meters from installations.

Guidance for Navigation in Oil-field Development Areas:

Plan passages to avoid oil-field development areas, if possible.

If transiting through an oil-field development area, stay within the designated safety fairway, if provided.

Avoid using offshore installations for position fixing without first identifying them.

Keep a good lookout for service craft, seismic survey vessels, and other craft in the area.

Maintain a listening watch on VHF 16 for safety broadcasts.

In bad weather, maintain additional safe clearance when navigating in these areas.

Monitor navigational warnings for the area.

If uncharted offshore installations are observed in the safety fairway, mark them on charts/ECDIS as additional information for future reference

####### Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA)

Introduction

- Ensure AIO in use is updated regularly.

- If T&P Notices are not available via AIO, insert these manually.

- Ships should use Fleet Operations Solutions to update catalogue, ENCs and ADPs.

####### Paper charts

- Maintain paper charts, if any, updated to the latest NTM.

###### Carriage of ENC’s, Charts and Publications Guidance

The 2nd officer shall follow these guidelines.

Assess the requirements for availability of adequate navigation charts using below tables:

ENC / SENC Scales

BA Paper Charts Scales

Use up to date ENCs providing ample coverage of the intended operating area at proper scale for safe navigation.

Use official paper charts as primary source for navigation:

- If a back-up ECDIS unit is not installed

- If the primary and secondary ECDIS units are out of order or

- Where appropriate scale ENCs are not available (see above table)

Note:	If paper charts are used, keep them corrected and up to date as per SOLAS Ch. V, Reg. 27.

Make sure that the Approach (4), harbour (5) and berthing (6) ENCs are available for the ports to be called

Note:	If approach (4), harbor (5) and berthing (6) ENCs are not available, request and carry on board the appropriate scale BA paper charts for these locations

Keep both ECDIS fully corrected so that each system contains the same updates with regard to:

- Notices to Mariners (NTM)

- Temporary and Preliminary Notices to Mariners (T&P)

- Navigation Warnings (Navarea and Navtex)

- Manual Corrections

- ADPs

- ENPs

Make sure you have coverage of ENCs, ADPs, charts and publications for adjacent sea areas, in case the vessel is ordered to a different trading area or there is a need for a larger deviation from the established route.

The following indications of a displayed ENC cell on chart panel are available in the ECDIS software:

Arrange ENC’s through the supplier and charts through the local agents if necessary and inform the operations department.

Caution:	Do not proceed on a voyage, or if the orders change during the passage, enter any area for which required updated ENC’s or charts and publications are not on board.

Consult with the master and decide what additional ENC’s, charts and publications will be required to cover eventualities such as:

- Being involved in search and rescue

- Seeking a port of refuge

Check the following publications are on board (Hard copy or digital):

- The mariner’s handbook

- Sailing directions

- Admiralty digital publications

- Tidal stream atlases

- Nautical almanac

- Nautical tables

- Notices to mariners (weekly, cumulative and annual summary)

- Admiralty chart catalogue & ENC catalogue

- Routing charts, ship's routing and supplements

##### Updating e-Navigational products

###### Introduction

Maintain e-Navigational products in updated condition. Follow the guidelines.

###### Updating e-Navigational products Guidance

The 2nd officer shall follow these guidelines.

Receive NTMs for ENCs on a weekly basis either:

- Through direct gateway connection to supplier’s servers

- Via e-mail (if online connection is not available)

Update the permits for ENCs prior conducting the update.

The e-navigation software, through direct gateway connection assists with the following:

- Ordering and delivery of:

- ENC licenses

- New ENCs

- ENC updates

- T&P NM’s

- ADPs and e-NPs

- Installation of:

- ENCs

- ENC updates

- Updates to admiralty digital catalogue

- Status report of the ship collection.

- Digital Admiralty publications

- Updates to Digital Admiralty publications

      - Note:	Admiralty information overlay includes all admiralty temporary and preliminary notices to mariners (T&P NM’s) and provides additional navigation significant information from UKHO’s ENC validation program

E-navigation software is updating the ENCs automatically when they are received, upon request generated by the user.

Caution: Do not request ENC, ADP or e-NP updates when the vessel is in a sensitive navigational area (e.g. when sailing in confined waters, in heavy traffic, nearby dangers to navigation, etc…), owing to implications for safety

Reason for above “Caution” are:

- Updating utilizes capacity of the computer

- Is diverting from its primary task

- Existing routes will need to be re-checked after an update

Note:	During the voyage, after each weekly update, carry out route check using the inbuilt ECDIS function and visually on 1:1 scale. Print out the records in pdf format as record of this check, as evidence that the check was performed.

      - Note:	Conduct a Risk Assessment prior to updating while under way. 
If considered safe, update the ECDIS one at a time (set synchronisation between ECDIS units “off”) to make sure the OOW retains an operational system.

When complete, check the updated ECDIS for correct performance before conducting the update on the next ECDIS or synchronising across the LAN.

The proper way of checking if all ENCs updates are in place is the ENC Report.

####### How to Request for Updates Guidance

The 2nd officer shall follow these guidelines.

Request to update the chart catalogue.

Load the catalogue after update is received, to see:

- If the required charts are installed

- If required charts are licensed

- If new charts or new editions are available

Request charts updates. Select request by route.

  - Caution! Do not request updates for full folio of charts installed, or when the vessel is in a sensitive navigational area

Observe the list of required charts in the lower right side of the display.

Check their status, either:

- Licensed

- Installed

- Not installed

- Not licensed

If internet connection is not working on board, request office for assistance (i.e. to download the ENC from the link provided and send it via e-mail).

Install the charts from the USB stick.

There are 21 operational NAVAREAs. NAVAREA warnings affecting the voyage are plotted on the ECDIS automatically.

Caution: plot Navarea warnings using “Manual Correction” if:

Any warnings are not automatically plotted on ECDIS

The vessel was out of the Navarea for more than a month (check with the MSI)

Manually plot any warning that represents a navigational danger along a corridor of 25 NM (port and starboard) of planned route

Insert a note on the warning to highlight that it was processed

The company has contracted services to provide vessels with the NAVAREA warnings in force. Receive navigational warnings via IMO/IHO approved broadcast systems, or from MSI. Consider GMDSS equipment as the main source for navigational warnings.

###### Management of NAVAREA Warnings Guidance

When the vessel enters a new NAVAREA:

- Review all warnings in force received via contracted system.

- Determine which ones are affecting areas along the vessel’s planned route.

- Set the ship’s GMDSS equipment (Sat-C) to receive the warnings pertaining to it.

- OOW manually plots any warning that affects the vessel’s navigational area on ECDIS by using Manual Corrections

- Record manual corrections in form ECDIS 04 – Manual Corrections Log.

When the warning is cancelled, or it is no longer relevant delete it from the Manual Corrections and make an entry accordingly in the ECDIS 04 – Manual Corrections Log.

On the start of a new voyage file the NAVAREA warnings received according to the area of navigation in a dedicated folder.

At the end of the voyage remove all warnings from the folder and archive for one year.

##### Management of Navtex Warnings

####### Introduction

The warnings relevant for the service areas of the NAVTEX transmitters are broadcasted twice or more times per day.

These warnings remain in force until cancelled and are broadcasted for as long as the information is valid.

Warnings may no longer be broadcast after a period if the details are available in notices to mariners.

###### Management of Navtex Warnings Guidance

All navigational officers shall become familiar with the operation of Navtex.

During sea passage select the applicable broadcasting stations to ensure that the warnings affecting the navigation area are received.

Monitor Navtex messages and mark them after they are processed.

Caution: plot Navtex warnings using “Manual Correction” if:

Any warnings are not automatically plotted on ECDIS

Manually plot any warning that represents a navigational danger along a corridor of 25 NM (port and starboard) of planned route

Insert a note on the warning to highlight that it was processed

On the start of a new voyage:

- Ensure that all Navtex warnings in force are plotted on ECDIS

- File the NAVTEX warnings in a dedicated folder, according to:

- The area of navigation

- The letter code of the station that transmitted them

- In force warnings should be kept in a new leaflet properly marked

On end of the voyage remove all warnings from the folder and archive for one year.

When a Navtex navigational warning is cancelled:

- Mark the filed leaflet containing the warning

- Remove the warning from the chart

### 4.1.6 Difficult Conditions - rev 0 issued 24.10.2024

##### Heavy Weather

###### Introduction

Use weather reports and forecasts to:

- Give adequate warning to the crew

- Prepare crew

- Secure the ship for extreme weather conditions

Develop a plan to prepare the vessel for extreme weather. Preparations fall into three categories to prevent:

- Damage to ship and equipment

- Injury to crew

- Damage or loss of cargo

###### Heavy Weather at Sea Guidance

The master and OOW shall follow these guidelines.

Any work on open decks during heavy weather is restricted and should be avoided.

When extreme weather is forecast, inform:

- Master

- Chief engineer

- Chief officer

Note: Considering the severity of the weather, decide on taking additional ballast in designated heavy weather ballast tanks.

Follow the guidelines below:

Secure:

- Lifeboats

- Life-rafts

- Deck fittings

- Cargo and provision cranes in cradles.

- Storerooms

- Mooring ropes

- Loose items

- Furniture

- Personal effects

- Televisions

- Other items

- Chemicals for cargo hold wash stored in forecastle store or deck lockers (Dry vessels only)

Caution: These chemicals should be avoided in compartments with remotely controlled dewatering systems, otherwise secure with extra lashing.

Close and secure against water ingress:

- Vents

- Air pipes

- Sounding pipes

- Forecastle openings

- Poop deck openings

- Watertight doors, if any

- Weather-tight doors

- Spurling pipes

For Dry Cargo Vessels Only:

- Batten down hatch covers

- Close and secure cargo hold ventilations

- Check and tighten cargo lashings at least twice a day (containers and breakbulk cargoes)

- Secure reefer container power supply connections

Caution: Be careful around reefer containers and connections to avoid electric shock from damaged wiring

- Test pre-alarm and alarm for hold, ballast, and dry space water ingress alarms

- Test forecastle and void space de-watering systems

- Test cargo hold bilge pumping and ballast systems.

For Tankers Only:

Secure cargo and ballast tank lids

Secure manholes

Close forecastle and deck store doors and ventilation openings

Rig safety lines on the safety walkways on the main deck.

Use extra lashings for:

Anchors

Gangways

Isolate power supply to:

Windlasses

Deck machinery

Cargo cranes

Adjust course and speed to reduce:

Extreme pitching

Pounding

Rolling

Note: To avoid damage to the vessel and cargo.

Post warning notices on doors leading to the open deck.

Note: Crew must report to the chief officer and bridge before going out of the accommodation.

Plan an alternate work schedule for the crew. If the crew is required to work on deck:

Get written instructions from the chief officer

Obtain a copy of:

The risk assessment worksheet

Permit to work on deck in heavy weather

Post a lookout to monitor crew safety

Receive reports when all crew are safely in the accommodation

Record the times of entry and exit from the deck in the deck logbook

Monitor weather reports. If necessary, request weather routing services. Update the ship’s position in the distress transmitting systems. Update the ship’s position with:

- AMVER

- Other position reporting systems

- If bad weather significantly changes ETA, inform:

- Owners

- Charterers

- Agents

- Other interested parties

Consider ballasting the fore peak tank to prevent damage due to:

Pounding

Panting

Note: There is a risk of damaging the vessel's bottom if proceeding too fast head-on into rough sea. After a prolonged period of rough weather, the wavelength may match the vessel's length. When the amidships section is in the trough, the crest of the oncoming wave may break over the bow at a speed of 50 knots plus the vessel's speed.

Check spaces on the forecastle for water ingress during and after bad weather, such as:

Chain lockers

Rope stores

Bow thruster room

Void spaces

Note: The OOW may find it difficult to evaluate the effect of heavy weather during darkness.

Record in the deck logbook the steps taken for the safety and security of the ship.

###### Handling Emergencies in Heavy Weather

The master and OOWs shall follow these guidelines.

No seafarer is allowed on open decks in heavy weather unless the master considers it necessary for safety.

If work on deck is necessary, e.g., in emergency situations, all safety precautions and procedures must be implemented, including a full risk assessment.

The master must consider all hazards and implement measures to minimize risks. If residual risk is moderate or higher, consult the office before sending people on deck.

Crew members assigned to work on deck should be involved in the risk management process and thoroughly briefed on existing hazards and the scope of work.

Consider the following in the risk assessment:

- Necessity of the work (is it necessary or can it be postponed?)

- Work permit

- Experience of assigned personnel

- Course and speed adjustment

- Rigging lifelines

- Lifejackets and safety harnesses

- Full PPE

- Working in a team

- Additional bridge lookout

- Constant communication and visual contact

- Deck lights

- Portable UHFs with waterproof cases

- Existence of “rogue” waves

- Expect sudden change in circumstances.

- Contingency plan

- Support team

Note: Do not take unnecessary risks unless justified. Always plan for and expect the unexpected. If in doubt, contact the office.

Caution: Before sending people on deck in heavy weather, ask yourself:

“Is it feasible and absolutely necessary?”

“Did I evaluate and mitigate all risks?”

“Are the people fully aware of risks?”

“Are the people confident the job can be done safely?”

“Can we postpone the job until the weather improves?”

##### Heavy Weather Ballasting

###### Introduction

MARPOL Annex I, Regulation 18.3.1 allows vessels to carry ballast water in cargo tanks when navigating in severe weather conditions for the safety of the ship. For bulk carriers, this procedure applies if they are provided with designated ballast cargo holds.

###### Responsibilities

Master

- Decides when to fill heavy weather ballast into any cargo tank or cargo hold (for dry cargo vessels).

- Takes necessary steps to increase the vessel’s draught if additional ballast is needed, preferably before departing from sheltered waters.

- Considers all safety aspects if taking heavy weather ballast after departure, including deviation, stopping or reducing speed, or returning to port.

- Exercises extreme caution to avoid sloshing damages when filling heavy weather ballast in exposed waters.

Caution: Sloshing is the violent movement of the fluid's surface in partially filled tanks or holds resulting from the motion of the ship in a seaway.

Consults the vessel’s appendix to class for any filling restrictions and notes related to sloshing damage.

Chief Officer

Carefully plans any heavy weather ballast intake before starting the operation.

Manages the actual heavy ballast operations from start to finish.

###### Heavy Weather Ballasting Guidance

The master and chief officer shall follow these guidelines.

When taking additional ballast due to severe weather conditions:

Avoid slack tanks.

Minimize longitudinal stresses.

Get approval from the office when taking heavy weather ballast in high-heat cargo tanks.

Note: Crude oil tankers are permitted to load such additional ballast only if the cargo tanks have been crude oil washed.

Record ballasting/de-ballasting of cargo tanks in the oil record book as per MARPOL Annex I, Regulation 36/34 (tankers only).

Note: Depending on the vessel’s design, the builder may have designated specific cargo tanks to be ballasted when transiting areas affected by heavy weather.

Load heavy weather ballast in these cargo tanks based on a written plan to improve the ship’s stability and avoid structural damage due to slamming.

Ballasting/de-ballasting operation (dry vessels only):

Fully open extra ballast vents to facilitate airflow due to the large volume of water.

Use the Ballast Water Treatment Plant (BWTP) for ballasting.

Note: If the vessel cannot de-ballast before entering port, treated ballast water is allowed to be discharged in port. If not fitted with BWTP, exchange ballast water at sea as per BWMP.

Follow guidelines from the Ballast Water Management Plan (BWMP).

Record operations in the ballast record book.

On tankers without designated heavy weather ballast tanks, follow these procedures and guidance.

Prepare a ship-specific heavy weather ballast operation plan as per form TANK 46:

The Chief officer prepares the plan; the master approves it.

Discuss the plan with all officers participating in the operation.

Address the following precautions:

Prepare a heavy weather ballast load plan with line-up sequence, general precautions, contingency measures, and pre-calculated stability and stress information for 25%, 50%, 75%, and full percent filling of applicable tank(s).

Prepare a risk assessment prior to taking heavy weather ballast.

Submit the heavy weather plan and risk assessment to the Marine & Safety Superintendent.

Complete checklist TANK 08 before heavy weather ballasting.

Ensure deck access safety during foul weather.

Verify pre-calculated stability and stress conditions against damage stability conditions.

In port, request permission from the terminal for additional ballast intake, or request sheltered anchorage after departure from berth.

In open waters, reduce speed and alter course if necessary.

Complete heavy weather ballast operation promptly and postpone other operations if necessary.

If carrying crude oil, perform COW for tanks nominated for heavy weather ballasting.

During heavy weather ballast operation:

Ensure O2 content in nominated tanks is under 8% vol if not gas-free.

Ensure safe deck access and continuous watch during ballasting.

Monitor tank venting.

Continuously monitor ullage, tank pressure, trim, and stability.

DO NOT OVERFLOW ballast water during the final stage of ballasting.

###### Heavy Weather De-Ballasting Guidance

Conduct de-ballasting as per BWMP (dry cargo vessels).

Prepare a heavy weather ballast discharge plan including line-up sequence, general precautions, contingency measures, and pre-calculated stability and stress information for full, 75%, 50%, 25%, and nil percent filling of applicable tank(s).

If tanks are not gas-free, operate the IG system throughout and keep O2 content under 8% vol.

Check for oil on top of the heavy weather ballast.

Handle ballast water as per MARPOL regulations if oil or traces of oil are present.

Transfer the last meter of innage in the cargo tank to a slop tank or discharge to shore reception facility, regardless of oil presence, unless the cargo tank has been thoroughly washed, dried, and mopped.

Note: A crude oil tanker may de-ballast heavy weather ballast outside special areas if the cargo tank was crude oil washed. If not, discharge to shore reception facility. Product tankers may de-ballast heavy weather ballast outside special areas if the previous cargo was non-persistent oil, as per MARPOL Annex I, Regulation 34.

##### Piracy Prevention

Introduction

Risk assessment is integral to voyage planning within a safety management system. Thorough advanced planning and risk assessment should use all available information. The risk assessment must reflect the specific voyage, ship, and operations, not just general advice.

Piracy Prevention Procedure

The Master (SSO) should ensure that voyage planning addresses any security considerations.

The passage plan and voyage charts should include security-related information for each leg of the voyage.

To plan a voyage or transit through a security risk area, the Master should have current threat information and a security risk assessment.

Include:

Relevant UKHO or equivalent security charts.

Industry best management practice guidance (BMP) publications.

Regional guidance where available.

Company-specific guidance regarding recommended routeing, speed, waiting areas, and anchorages.

Complete a detailed threat and risk assessment for each voyage and activity within a security risk area.

Note: Review and update the risk assessment before entering an area requiring increased readiness and vigilance; amend the passage plan if necessary.

The passage plan should identify points where there will be:

Changes to security levels.

Points for maritime reports (e.g., entering a VRA).

Enhanced bridge manning levels.

Vessel speed requirements.

Restricted access controls.

Voyage day/night transit considerations.

Hardening of the vessel.

Note: Do not conduct planned maintenance on critical equipment during the voyage.

Before each voyage, the Master (SSO) and DSSO should ensure the vessel has all relevant security information, including:

Maritime security charts.

Industry BMP guidance.

Regional security guidance and information.

Completed voyage security risk assessment identifying ship protection measures.

Review and update the risk assessment before entering an area requiring increased readiness and vigilance, and amend the passage plan if necessary.

Contact the vessel operator (CSO) for the latest security-related information for the next voyage.

### To be archived 4.1.8 Ice Navigation - rev 0 issued 24.10.2024

##### ICE NAVIGATION

###### Purpose

This procedure is intended to assist the master in voyage planning prior to navigation in Ice- Covered Waters.

###### Scope

This procedure applies to vessels operating in ice-covered waters.

###### Responsibilities

The master shall implement and comply with this procedure.

###### Insurance.

The underwriters view on ice in general is, that where there is ice there is damage. 
Trading in ice is in most cases in breach of trading warranties and owners negotiate an additional premium for the H&M insurance.

If your vessel is required to navigate in ice, make sure that the company is advised accordingly.

Ice Navigator

Assess each voyage to areas with sub-zero conditions to determine any existing local regulations or recommendations for using ice navigators. The company may deploy its own ice navigators who meet the following qualifications:

Be qualified to act as a Master or person in charge of the deck watch in accordance with STCW.

Have served as a master or deck watch officer for at least 50 days, with 30 days in Arctic waters requiring ice-breaker assistance or manoeuvres to avoid ice concentrations.

Be a supernumerary officer, adjunct to the regular bridge team.

Have documentary evidence of having satisfactorily completed an approved training program in ice navigation.

Possess the latest ice and meteorological information.

Pre-Planning
Consider the following:

Do not enter ice if its type and concentration are unknown.

Know the parameters of the vessel’s ice class and its capabilities.

Prepare the vessel for cold weather operation as per ship-specific instructions.

Expect harsh environments:

Arctic temperatures can drop below -40°C in winter.

Daylight during winter in northern waters is limited or non-existent.

Strong winds and poor visibility are common in high latitudes.

Consider bunker requirements:

High boiler consumption is likely.

Evaluate stock of provisions and fresh water, considering delays are common.

Ensure the crew has proper protective clothing.

Complete ballast exchange before reaching cold weather areas.

Account for the negative effects of icing in stability calculations.

Adjust the vessel's draft to keep the rudder and propeller well submerged, avoiding excessive trim.

Risk Assessment

The office shall check the vessel's suitability to operate in ice-covered waters. Conduct a risk assessment before entering ice-covered waters, considering:

Potential hazards and hypothetical risk scenarios.

Probability and consequences of each scenario.

Implementation of prevention or mitigation steps.

Ice class notation.

Use of ice advisors (especially if the bridge team has limited ice navigation experience).

Increased manning levels (especially the bridge team).

Increased reserve bunkers and stores.

Additional arrival UKC (allowance for ice accretion impact on draft and trim).

Risk of getting stuck in the ice and precautions to be observed.

Voyage Plan

Plan the voyage per the HSEQ manual and continually review it. Consider the following:

The longer route around difficult ice areas is often the fastest and safest.

Obtain all available information regarding ice conditions in the expected navigation area.

Be aware that early or late season voyages are more challenging.

Use available ice charts and ice condition information transmitted regularly.

Expect most conventional buoys to be withdrawn during the ice season and replaced by unlit winter spar buoys, which can be damaged or hidden.

Maintain a larger than usual safety distance from dangerous obstacles and "no-go" areas.

Prepare for double watch on the bridge and avoid using automatic steering in ice.

It is recommended that the engine room be manned around the clock in ice.

The available charts for Arctic waters are often based on old or inaccurate surveys. Take the following precautions:

Check the chart projection and its limitations.

Check survey dates.

Use range and bearing to transfer positions between charts.

Check for evidence of reconnaissance soundings.

Verify the method of measuring distances and bearings.

###### Ice Charts

Obtain ice charts from shore services. Some of these are shown in below links:

Canadian Waters – Western Arctic

National Weather Service – NWS Alaska Sea Ice Program

Finnish Meteorological Institute – Baltic Sea

###### Effect of High Latitude on Compasses

The magnetic compass can be erratic in the Arctic and is frequently of little use for navigation. Check the error frequently.

The gyro compass is reliable up to about 70°N latitude. Beyond 70°N, take special care in checking its accuracy as it loses horizontal force and becomes unusable north of about 85°N.

Numerous course and speed changes and collisions with ice can affect the gyro compass's accuracy. Check it whenever possible.

###### Position Fixing in Arctic Waters

Problems with positioning arise from mistaken shore feature identification or inaccurate surveys.

Low relief in some parts of the Arctic makes it difficult to identify landmarks. Ice may obscure the coastline.

Treat radar bearings and ranges with caution and prefer visual observations.

Large areas of the Arctic have not been surveyed to the same standard as further south. Recently produced charts may be based on aerial photography.

Minimize errors by using three lines (range or bearings) for positions. Avoid fixes using both sides of a channel or lines from different survey areas.

Compare fixes in the Arctic with other sources, such as electronic position systems.

###### Detecting the Ice:

ICE BLINK

Ice blink, which is fairly reliable, can be the first indication that an ice field is near. It appears as a luminous reflection on the underside of the clouds above the ice. On a clear day, it's less apparent but may appear as a light or yellowish haze.

SMALL FRAGMENTS OF ICE

Sighting small fragments of ice often indicates that larger quantities are not far away.

MODERATION OF SEA AND SWELL

An abrupt moderation of sea and swell occurs when approaching an ice field from leeward.

RADAR

Radar can be a great asset in ice navigation, but only if the display is properly interpreted. Ice makes a poor radar target beyond 3 to 4 miles range.

Areas of open water and smooth floes appear very similar on the display. In an ice field, the edge of a smooth floe can be prominent, whereas the edge of open water is not.

Ice close to shore and attached to the shore may appear on the display as part of the land. By reducing the receiver's gain, it should be possible to differentiate between the shore and the ice.

The absence of sea clutter on parts of the display may indicate the presence of ice.

Although ridges show up well on the display, it's difficult to differentiate between ridges, closed tracks, and rafted ice.

Depending on their size and shape, icebergs may be detected at a range between 4 and 15 miles under good radar conditions. The sector on the display directly behind the iceberg will be free of clutter.

Growlers pose an immense danger to ships. They are almost impossible to detect by radar because they have a very smooth surface and may be completely covered by waves.

A good visual lookout using high-quality binoculars is imperative.

###### Entering the Ice

Do not enter the ice if an alternative, although longer, route is available.

Comply with the recommended routes through the ice if available for the area.

Enter the ice at the lowest possible speed to receive the initial impact. Once into the ice, the speed can be increased to maintain headway and control of the ship.

Advise the engine room of the situation (the possibility of clogging of sea water inlets, etc.) and the expected conditions, and ensure they are prepared for maneuvers at any time, including sudden full astern maneuvers.

Approach the ice edge at a right angle.

###### Navigating in Ice

The first principle of successful ice navigation is to maintain freedom of maneuver.

In higher concentrations of ice, three basic ship handling rules apply:

Keep moving - even very slowly. Avoid getting stuck and find the weak spots in the ice.

Try to work with the ice movement, not against it.

It's very easy and extremely dangerous to underestimate the hardness of the ice. Excessive speed is the major cause of damage to ships by ice.

The wind and waves can cause the ice to build up and form a barrier between the open sea and the sheltered waters. Such a barrier can reach the full depth of the water, and only the most powerful ships can force their way through.

Moving ice is always a danger. Ice moves under the influence of the wind, current, and tide. When the ice stops, it is compressed, and when it collides with slower ice, ice drifts build up, creating ice ridges.

Ice ridges multiply during winter. As the wind shifts and the ice drifts in various directions, the ridges follow the ice until the sea freezes.

Avoid pressure ridges; an ice ridge of 2 meters can have a keel of about 6 meters or more.

Do not attempt passage through pack ice under pressure.

Give wide berth to all forms of glacial ice (icebergs, bergy bits, and growlers) in the pack, as they are current-driven while the pack is wind-driven.

Avoid contact with old ice as it is usually harder, stronger, and thicker than first-year ice.

Rafted, ridged, and rubbled ice presents significant impediments to a ship's progress.

Snow on the ice directly influences the vessel's performance, increasing the friction coefficient between the vessel and the ice.

Once a ship becomes beset in the ice, it goes where the ice goes.

###### Backing in Ice

Avoid backing in ice as it exposes the rudder and propeller to the ice.

Check the area astern carefully to verify that the ice condition allows for the intended maneuver.

Keep the rudder amidships.

Use the minimum required power.

If ice starts to build up under the stern, use a short burst of power ahead to clear away the ice.

Watch the distance carefully to any ice edge. If necessary, place a reliable lookout on the poop deck with a radio.

###### Turning in the Ice

Ice often significantly influences steering. The ship may follow the path of least resistance, and ice can fully determine the vessel's heading, irrespective of the rudder position.

If possible, change course in relatively light ice, as turning in ice requires substantially more power than in water.

If a sharp turn is needed and progress is marginal, the effect of the drag of the turned rudder may halt the vessel's progress. In such cases, turn the vessel short round in the ice by backing and filling with the engine and rudder. Weigh the dangers of backing in ice against the navigational dangers of a long turn in the ice.

###### Safe Speed in Ice

Ice damage often results from excessive speed in ice conditions, particularly in broken ice in low to moderate concentrations.

Damage is less likely in severe ice conditions when speed is reduced to match conditions.

The force of impact varies as the square of the speed. For example, increasing speed from 8 to 12 knots more than doubles the impact force with any ice.

Prudent speed considers visibility, ice type and concentration, the vessel's ice class, and maneuvering characteristics (how quickly it can be stopped).

As long as the vessel is moving steadily, the speed is not too slow.

###### Precautions Against Being Beset

Avoid ice under pressure to prevent being beset.

The danger of being beset increases in the presence of old or glacial ice, as the pressure on the hull is greater.

In pack ice, watch the track behind the vessel closely. If the ice begins to close up completely behind the ship, pressure increases.

If stuck in ice, remember that a small change in trim or heel can free the ship. Using ballast transfer might cause the vessel to come free suddenly; be aware of possible consequences.

Another method to free the vessel is using the engine ahead and astern at max power while alternating the rudder from port to starboard. Check that no ice goes through the propeller when going astern, or that the vessel doesn't go astern into heavy ice if it suddenly frees itself.

If stuck in ice, keep the propeller turning at minimum RPM to avoid stopping it completely.

###### Navigating in Ice During Darkness and Reduced Visibility

Avoid navigating in ice during dark hours unless the vessel is equipped with strong and efficient searchlights controlled from the conning station.

Reduce speed to match visibility and ice conditions.

In poor visibility, echoes on the monitor from another ship may appear similar to ice or icebergs, potentially causing dangerous close-quarter situations.

###### Ice Navigation Assisted by Icebreaker

During hours of darkness, icebreakers use special visual signals for identification. In some areas, such as the Baltic and Canadian waters, icebreakers use special signals (two rotating lights and/or a Zet-horn facing aft) if they get stuck in the ice. Pay special attention to the following:

Keep a careful watch for signals from the icebreaker. Constantly monitor the recommended VHF channel.

Always keep the vessel’s propulsion machinery ready for rapid maneuvers. Report any problems regarding engine power or maneuvering capabilities to the icebreaker immediately.

To avoid collisions, inform the icebreaker without delay if you stop or slow down substantially.

If the vessel stops due to ice conditions, switch off the searchlight while stationary.

If the vessel sustains or is suspected to have sustained damage, inform the icebreaker immediately.

The master of the escorted vessel is responsible for maintaining the vessel's position within the minimum and maximum escort distances.

If the escorted vessel needs to perform an emergency stop because the icebreaker gets stuck, putting the rudder hard over will assist in reducing the stopping distance.

The commanding officer of the icebreaker will determine the minimum escort distance based on the escorted vessel's stopping distance using the engine at full astern from normal full ahead.

The maximum escort distance is determined based on ice conditions and the distance at which the track remains open.

###### Convoys

A convoy of ships is formed by the commanding officer of the icebreaker, who will determine the order of station for each vessel within the convoy. The ships in the convoy are responsible for arranging and maintaining a suitable and safe distance between vessels.

The icebreaker will determine the required distance to be maintained between itself and the lead ship of the convoy.

When in a convoy, maintain communication not only with the icebreaker but also with the vessels ahead and astern of your vessel.

Any vessel that does not comply with the instructions or orders given by the icebreaker cannot expect assistance.

###### Towage

In difficult ice conditions, towing may be the only means of ensuring assistance.

The vessel shall be prepared to make fast or cast off at any time. The icebreaker decides if and when a vessel is taken into tow.

Use the vessel's propulsion machinery as per instructions from the icebreaker.

Use only manual steering and try to remain in line with the icebreaker.

###### Damages to Vessel in Ice and Their Main Causes

Dents and ruptures due to ship-ice contact:

Excessive speed is the main cause of damage when entering the ice or navigating in loose pack ice or a mix of new, old, and glacial ice.

Turning in an ice channel can subject the mid and aft sections of the hull to high pressure from the ice edge.

Propeller and rudder damages:

These commonly occur when backing in ice and during maneuvering in port.

Collisions due to ice:

Most collisions occur when vessels are moving in an ice channel successively with a short lead, in towing situations, or if the icebreaker is cutting too close at high speed.

If vessels are operating independently, steering can be influenced by the ice, causing sudden and unexpected changes in heading and potential collisions. Use extreme caution if your distance to another ship is less than your stopping distance.

Engine damage:

Cooling problems are common when navigating in brash ice or slush ice. Excessive loads on the thrust bearing and stern tube can also be experienced.

The steering gear can be subjected to excessive loads during ice navigation, particularly with numerous and rapid full port and starboard maneuvers, and when backing in the ice.

Grounding due to ice:

The vessel may ground if beset in the ice and the ice starts drifting, or if control of the heading is lost due to the ice.

Maneuvering in port:

Ice rubble in port may become several meters thick and can contain objects like rocks and wood, exposing the propeller and rudder when making ahead and astern maneuvers.

###### Reporting on Ice Accretion

If ice accretion occurs, send a report detailing the following information:

Date and time (UTC)

Vessel's position

Course and speed

Wind direction and speed

Air and sea temperatures

Extent of ice accretion

Actions being taken to avoid further accretion

Best estimate of GM (metacentric height)

##### Automatic Identification System (AIS)

###### Introduction

The AIS is an automatic ship tracking and identification system that operates in the marine VHF band.

IMO resolution A.1106(29) provides guidelines for onboard operational use of AIS

The AIS provides and receives information of AIS fitted vessels within VHF range on the:

- Identity

- Type

- Position

- Course

- Speed

- Navigation status

- Other safety-related information

AIS is a useful tool for assisting with collision avoidance because course alterations of other vessels are quickly apparent.

Note:	Use AIS information only to assist in collision avoidance decision-making. 
When using the AIS in the ship-to-ship mode for anti-collision purposes:

Treat AIS as an additional source of navigational information.
 (It supports navigational systems such as ARPA and VTS)

Comply with the collision regulations, particularly rule 7 to determining whether risk of collisions exists.

The AIS transmits three types of information:

- Static information is entered upon installation as per the ship’s registration particulars:

- MMSI

- Call sign

- Name

- IMO number

- Length

- Beam

- Ship type

- Antenna location

- Dynamic information is updated automatically from the ship’s own sensors and equipment:

- Ship’s position with accuracy indication and integrity status

- Position time stamp in UTC

- Course over ground

- Speed over ground

- Heading

- Navigational status

- Rate of turn

Note:	AIS information regarding the ship’s position, course and speed transmitted from the vessel may be recorded and retained by shore-based monitoring stations such as VTS.

- Enter voyage related information at the commencement of each voyage or if there are any changes:

- Ship's draught

- Hazardous cargo

- Departure, destination and ETA

- Route plan (way points)

- The correct navigational status

- Short safety-related text messages

Short safety-related messages are manually entered, addressed either a specific addressee or broadcast to all ships and shore stations. These are in free format.

Check below dynamic AIS information once per voyage or once per month

- Positions given as per WGS 84

- Speed over ground

- Sensor information

Increase the frequency of checks in coastal waters The AIS displays may be integrated into the radar units and ECDIS.

Place the AIS display screen in a location close to the radar, so that comparisons can be made between the two sets of data and radar targets properly identified.

Confidentiality: When entering any data manually, consider the confidentiality of this information.

Note:	International agreements, rules or standards provide for the protection of navigational information.

CAUTION! Not all vessels carry AIS. The (OOW) should be aware that other vessels, in particular leisure craft, fishing boats and warships, also some coastal shore stations including Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) centers, might not be fitted with AIS.

Note:	The OOW should be aware that AIS fitted on other ships as a mandatory carriage requirement might, under certain circumstances, be switched off on the master's professional judgement.

AIS Use Procedure

The master and navigating officers do this procedure.

Caution:	Do not generate and transmit false messages via AIS.
Masters are warned that national administrations impose severe penalties for fraudulent transmissions

- Input voyage-related data at the start of the voyage and whenever changes occur

- Use the AIS when underway or at anchor

- Familiarize with the operating procedures

- If AIS might compromise the safety or security of the ship or where security incidents are imminent, switch off AIS, at master’s discretion

- if the ship is operating in a mandatory ship reporting system, the master should report this action and the reason for doing so to the competent authority

- Record such actions in the logbook together with the reasons for doing so

- Restart the AIS as soon as the source of danger has disappeared

- Operate the AIS at 1W power in port, at SPM or MBM, or as per port requirements

Note: agree on AIS status and settings with the terminal representatives

- Carry out the self-diagnostic test every noon

- Carry out event log check for data correctness at least once a month

- Make frequent checks that course and speed data transmitted by own ship is accurate, but at least once a month

- Use discretion while transiting areas known for incidents of armed robbery and piracy to switch off the AIS for safety or security reasons

- Record such action in the deck logbook

- Report to:

- The company security officer

- Coastal state authority in which the ship is operating

- Check quality of broadcast, particularly in areas of high density or reduced visibility

Note:	Poor quality broadcast data lowers confidence in observed data of other ships and can reduce potential gains to be had from this equipment.

- Use VHF equipment for AIS Broadcasts during STS operations at normal power (as per STS transfer guide 3.10.5.2)

Completed

##### Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System (BNWAS)

###### Introduction

The bridge navigational watch alarm system helps maintain awareness of the OOW.

The system automatically alerts the master or another officer if the OOW becomes incapable of performing his duties.

The BNWAS generates a series of indications and alarms as follows:

- Stage 1 Audible and visual alarm local to the wheelhouse only

- Stage 2 Additional audible and visual alarm in chosen officer’s cabin

- Stage 3 Additional audible alarm ship-wide

The BNWAS:

- Provides the OOW with means of calling for immediate assistance when required

- Counts the dormant period from the moment the system has been switched on

- Activates various alert stages if dormant period is over without OOW to reset the system

There may be 3 operational modes for the BNWAS: OFF / Manual ON / Automatic Mode:

- MANUAL OFF: disables the BNWAS but still allows the Emergency Call function

Note:	The system does not carry out the watch-monitoring - Harbor mode

- MANUAL ON: selects permanent active, not waiting for autopilot engagement or GPS to indicate ship is under way

Note:		The system always carries out watch-monitoring.

- AUTOMATIC MODE: The BNWAS is automatically activated when the vessel is navigating by means of heading or track control system (autopilot/track pilot), and inhibited as the heading/track control system is deactivated.

Caution: Do not use automatic mode of the BNWAS, if available.

BNWAS Use Procedure

The master and navigating officers do this procedure.

Use the BNWAS whenever the ship is underway at sea and at anchor

Master

- Set the appropriate BNWAS configuration and select the dormant period duration on safe side. It should be normally set to 12 minutes.

- Keep the key/passcodes in his custody

OOW

- Perform checks to include:

- Error messages daily

- Loop test as per makers manual daily

- 2nd and 3rd alarm level tests at least each month

- Main power failure alarm at least each month

Note:	Include gyro stabilized units in the radars and ARPA.

Check compass errors at each watch

- Use one of the following means:

- Azimuth

- Amplitude

- Transit bearing

- Record the resultant error in the compass error book

Compare the gyro readings to the magnetic compass readings every watch and after significant alterations

Carry out maintenance, as far as practicable, when the vessel is in the port

On completion of maintenance work

- Re-start the compass in sufficient time for it to settle

- Check it before use to verify that its readings are correct

Completed

###### Magnetic Compass

Using Magnetic Compass Procedure

The master and OOW shall do this procedure.

Calculate the magnetic compass error every watch, if possible, and after each major course alteration

Observe deviation using:

- Known transits on coastal passage

- Celestial observations while on offshore voyages

Record the deviation in compass observation book and deck logbook

Compare daily the Readings of the Magnetic Compass and the Magnetic Compass Transmitting Heading Sensor operating panel, record in deck logbook.

Note: Readings difference within  1 Degree is acceptable.

If there has been a marked change in the deviations, readjust the compass

Record the dates of adjustment of compasses in the compass error book

Master shall carry out full swing every year to compare the deviation for each course with deviation card

Master shall prepare a magnetic compass deviation curve and place next to the original card issued by the certified compass adjuster, for comparison only

Note:	If possible verify magnetic compass deviation in vicinity of leading marks or lights, where the true course can be easily determined

Adjust the magnetic compass using a certified compass adjuster when:

- It is first installed

- You doubt the satisfactory operation of the compass

- The ship undergoes structural repairs or alterations that could affect its permanent and induced magnetism

- Electrical or magnetic equipment in the vicinity of the compass is added, removed or altered

- The compass shows physical defects

- After two years since the last adjustment if records of compass deviations have not been maintained

- The deviation is observed to constantly be +/- 3 degrees or more when compared with the original deviation card

- If the deviation obtained to be +/- 5 degrees or above on any given course

- After dry dock, when the ship magnetism is settled

- After the vessel has been laid up or has been lying idle

Note:	Serious deviations may be experienced even after a short period of idleness, particularly in the case of small vessels

Prepare a compass deviation card after each adjustment and have the certified compass adjuster sign it

Store spare magnetic compasses upside down

Note:	To avoid wear of the needle bearing

Completed

####### Effect of impressed current cathodic hull protection system

Electromagnetic fields set up by impressed current cathodic hull protection systems can greatly influence magnetic compasses.

Deviation with the system will vary with:

- Draft

- Submerged coating condition

- Electrical flow through the system

- Whether system is switched on or off

Deviation tables and compass observation will be affected by the system

If required to steer the vessel using magnetic compass, switch off the system.

Note:	 Some countries require flags to be flown day and night. E.g. Chile and Saudi Arabia. Confirm with the port agent for advice.

###### Responsibilities

The 3rd officer is responsible for ensuring that the vessel has the correct flags on board and for the maintenance of flags and associated equipment including halyards and blocks

Flags Procedure

The 3rd officer is responsible for this procedure

- Carry the following flags on board:

- A full set of international code flags.

Note:	Letters A to Z, numerals 0 to 9, 1st, 2nd and 3rd substitutes and answering pennant

- Spare flags for the most frequently used flags, e.g. B, G, H, and Q.

- One national flag of all the countries to be visited during the current employment

- Spare flag for the more frequently visited countries

### 4.2.2 ECDIS Management - rev 0 issued 24.10.2024

##### ECDIS

###### Introduction

This procedure guides the ship’s staff in correct use of the ECDIS for a safe, uneventful voyage.

ECDIS is only as accurate as the information contained within it, whether from sensors or installed data.

Note:	ECDIS depends on the accuracy of the sensors or installed data. Configure it correctly prior sailing.

The system is not protected against viruses due to conflicts between antivirus and ECDIS software.

There are three mandatory sensor inputs to ECDIS as stated in IMO MSC 232(82):

- GNSS

- Ship's gyro compass.

- The speed and distance measuring device.

Additional sensors may also be interfaced.

ECDIS may also be used to provide SENC information to external equipment such as radar.

System electronic navigational chart (SENC) means:

- A database resulting from the transformation of the ENC by ECDIS for appropriate use

- Updates to the ENC by appropriate means

- Other data added by the mariner

ECDIS accesses this database for display generation and other navigational functions.

The SENC may also contain information from other sources.

To provide redundancy of sensors, typical ECDIS configuration on company’s vessels is as follows:

- GPS 1 Or DGPS 1

- GPS 2 or DGPS 2

- GYRO 1

- GYRO 2

- Log

- AIS

- Echo sounder

- Anemometer

- NAVTEX

- ARPA 1

- ARPA 2

During installation configure and calibrate all sensor inputs to ECDIS, using approved service provider.

Caution:	Do not attempt to change configuration and initial settings without prior approval from office and without remote assistance from manufacturer’s customer support service.

###### Responsibility

- The 2nd officer shall configure the systems considering:

- Correct ENCs for the area of operation are installed and updated

- Chart priority

- Sensor offsets

- Ship specific data

- Security settings such as passwords and restricted menu access

- Check the intended route

- Make a spot check of entire folio of installed charts

- Make a backup of system data at regular intervals

- Make sure that the systems are configured so that it is possible to reconstruct the ship's track from recorded ECDIS data

- Set the ECDIS to preserve the record of the previous 24 hours and of the entire voyage track. The data should be recorded at one minute intervals

- A record of own ship's past track: time, position, heading, and speed and

- Prefix the ECDIS terminals as primary or secondary

- Configure the primary ECDIS as the master unit

- If two GNSS systems are available, use a different input for primary position source as this allows the monitoring of both GNSS inputs at any given time

- If a secondary GNSS position source is not available, the next best position source is to be selected

- Set the Primary unit alarm sound to ON

- Set the Primary unit to display charts at the best scale

- Use ECDIS Check List 03 for guidance on settings and configuration

      - Note:	ECDIS software is prone to malfunction if it is not shut down in a controlled manner. Failure to do so may result in loss of data and failure of the system to restart.

      - The ECDIS software is shut down first according to the manufacturer's guidance before powering down the system. Shutting down the system and re-booting it should be done after arrival in the port, while alongside.

- The OOW should:

- Compare information provided by ECDIS against other sources of information and the picture they are seeing out of the window

- Use the ECDIS wisely to enhance situational awareness, in conjunction with keeping a proper lookout

- Check the quality of all sensor inputs to ECDIS

Note: ECDIS sensors input – GPS, Speed and Gyro – shall be checked every watch as part of “Changeover the Watch” procedure

- Know the primary position source being used by ECDIS

- Correlate positional information whether visual, radar or from other electronic navigation aids, particularly when making landfall

- Pay attention to the configuration of the display of both bridge ECDIS terminals at watch handovers

- Read and understand alarms and warnings before acknowledging same

- Know where to find details of an acknowledged alarm or warning if required

- Keep chart auto-load and chart auto-scale always ON

Caution!	Do not disregard visual position information, particularly when it does not tie in with positional information displayed on ECDIS as GNSS (including Differential GPS) can fail, be jammed and may be prone to drift.

- Call the master and the second officer in the following circumstances:

- Failure of any of the bridge ECDIS units

- Failure of any of the three compulsory sensors (GPS, Gyro, Speed Log)

- If an unplanned change in safety settings (safety frame, safety contour) is considered necessary

- Where doubt or discrepancy exists

###### Limitations of ECDIS

ECDIS brings tremendous advantages to navigators in the form of information, position-keeping and situational awareness.

Be vigilant to avoid over-reliance, which could lead a vessel into danger.

Cross-check the picture presented by ECDIS against other navigational systems or sources of information.

Among the dangers associated with over-reliance on ECDIS are:

- Improper functioning of the ECDIS itself

- An incorrect position fix via satellite systems

- Incorrect chart data

- Faulty sensor readings

- Human error

- A false sense of security, leading to unjustified risk-taking

##### Use of Electronic Charts

###### Introduction

Electronic navigational chart (ENC) is the database, standardized as to content, structure and format, issued for use with ECDIS by authorized hydrographic offices.

ENC’s are layered with digital information enabling the mariner to interrogate features on the chart, for detailed information, such as:

- Buoys

- Navigational marks

- Traffic separation schemes (TSS)

- Safety contours

Different types of visual and audible navigational alarms can be set to act as a warning to the mariner to give a clear indication of any dangers that lay ahead.

The alarms can include such hazards as:

- Shallow depths

- Shoals

- Isolated dangers

- Minimum under-keel clearance (e.g. anti-grounding alarm)

Early warning alarms can also be specified for:

- Approaching waypoints

- Alteration of course points

- Position fixing reminders

- Changing electronic chart alarms

At Reederei Nord the ENCs are supplied by E-Navigation supplier and weekly updates are done via E-Navigation supplier gateway system or via e-mail

ECDIS system offers additional databases for tidal information, including predictions and automatic calculation of:

- High water

- Low water

- Tidal heights

- Streams

###### Use of ECDIS at Night

Configure the color palette to suit the environmental conditions so that charted information, in particular safety critical information, is not hidden or difficult to see.

###### Checking Accuracy of Sensors

Check the accuracy of sensors using methods listed below:

GNSS

- By conducting operator fixes using visual means

- By comparing ENC objects/contours with RADAR overlay (RIO), where available

GYRO

- By conducting a bearing check of a charted transit

- By using the bearing of a distant object method

- Bearing of a heavenly body technique

LOG

- By using the measured mile method or similar technique

Echo Sounder

- Check accuracy using lead line

- Crosscheck echosounder readings when passing over bathymetric lines

- Crosscheck echosounder readings when navigating in controlled depth areas

RADAR

- Check accuracy by regularly conducting index error checks and operator fixes

If Sensor Input Failure is detected, consult checklist Form EMER 12A checking following points:

- Identify the failed sensory input

- Inform the master

- Examine necessity changing watch manning level

- Examine whether the failed sensory input affects the navigation of the ship

- Implement back‐up protocols as per the IMS procedure to make sure safe navigation

Note: Such as using alternate sensors

- Examine whether the failed sensory input affects any other electronic systems

- Identify a rectification action to repair the sensory input

- Examine whether the ship's passage plan need to be amended

##### Alert Management

###### Introduction

ECDIS alert management is very critical

Warning!

On ECDIS the compulsory alarms are password protected.

The password prevents accidental changes to the system.

User knowledge and recognition of ECDIS alerts is required.

Alarm – high-priority alert. Condition requiring immediate attention and action by the bridge team, to maintain the safe navigation of the ship.

Warning – condition requiring immediate attention, but no immediate action by the bridge team. Warnings are presented for precautionary reasons to make the bridge team aware of changed conditions which are not immediately hazardous but may become so if no action is taken.

Caution - lowest priority of an alert. Awareness of a condition which does not warrant an alarm or warning condition, but still requires attention out of the ordinary consideration of the situation or of given information.

###### Alert Acknowledgement

After familiarising him/herself with an alert, the operator acknowledges it. User knowledge and recognition of ECDIS alerts is required.

####### Main Alert Generation Principles

####### Navigational Alerts

Navigational alerts are intended for alerting the navigator to the change of own ship position and chart information display conditions. An ECDIS system should generate the following navigational alerts:

- Position monitor

- Heading Monitor

- HDG Monitor impossible

- Off chart

- Sounder depth

- Outside anchorage area

####### Route Alerts

The Route alerts notify about the ship’s exit beyond the boundary of set limitations during the sailing along the route. The following Route alerts should be generated on ECDIS:

- Course difference

- Off-Track

- Ahead the schedule or Behind the schedule

- Approach critical point

- End of track

####### Target/Radar Alerts

Target/Radar alerts about events connected with targets and sensors which transmit target information to the MFD.

A target is dangerous when both its CPA and TCPA values are smaller than the CPA and TCPA values set in the Alarm group of the Targets panel. In this case the Wxx CPA/TCPA Tgt ID alarm is generated (Wxx - WS name and Tgt ID - AIS or ARPA target ID). The following Target/Radar Alerts should be generated on ECDIS as well:

- AIS capacity

- ARPA capacity

- Lost target

- Guard zone

####### Sensor Alarms

Sensor alerts are generated in the absence of data from external sensors selected as data sources. These alerts are not generated unless the connected sensors have been selected by the user for the information sources. The alerts of this group are generated when there is no data from the sensor (sensor failure or connecting cable broken) or when sentences received from sensors have empty fields which should have contained necessary data or contain unreliable data.

####### Hardware Alerts

Hardware alerts are generated by faults in the operation of hardware, which the system consists of.

####### Safety Alerts

Navigation in the areas crowded with dangers to navigation requires permanent monitoring. With this aim in view, the ECDIS task implements functions for setting and monitoring safe navigation parameters on vector electronic charts.

Chart objects are identified by the ECDIS task as dangers to navigation by certain parameters. In the ECDIS task, such parameters are referred to as safety parameters and are set by the operator:

- Safety Depth

- Safety contour

The main means of determining the safety alerts operation is the Safety Frame. Dangerous objects turning up within the Safety Frame cause generation of a relevant alert.

Note:	Chapter 12.8 Equipment / ECDIS / ECDIS Safety Functions gives guidance on the correct set up procedure for Safety Depth / Safety Contour and Safety Frame.

Alerts are generated for the following chart objects:

- Beacons.

- Buoys.

- Bridges.

- Overhead cables.

- Pipelines.

- Mechanical apparatus for moving bulk material or people.

- The equipment or structure used to secure a vessel.

- Marine farm/culture; obstruction.

- Areas of ice over land or water.

- Boat-like structure used instead of a light buoy.

- Distinctively marked vessels anchored or moored at a charted point, to serve as an aid to navigation.

- Maritime areas enclosed with connected floating timbers used as staging areas for sawn logs.

- Constructions to dam oil flow on water.

- Long heavy timbers or sections of steel, wood, concrete, etc. forced into the earth which may serve as a support for a pier, or a free-standing pole within a marine environment;

- Vertical constructions consisting, for example, of a steel framework or pre-stressed concrete to carry cables, a bridge, etc.

- Obstructions that hinder or prevent movement, particularly anything that endangers or prevents passage of a vessel

- Concreted mass of stony material or coral which dries, is awash or is below the water surface.

- Wrecks.

- Updating objects which have the “Danger” and/or “Depth” attributes.

- Symbols of NAVTEX messages with “Danger” attribute.

####### Area alerts

An ECDIS system should detect the following area type objects if appropriate checkboxes are selected and activate a Caution:

- IMO areas

- Additional areas

###### Indications and Notifications

####### Indication

Display of regular information and conditions, not part of alert management.

Indications are displayed in “Indications window” on the Control panel.

The following indications are implemented in the ECDIS task:

Default Safety Contour - this indication is displayed in the following cases:

- If the mariner does not specify a safety contour (30 m is set by default). If the safety contour specified by the mariner or the default 30 m contour is not in the displayed SENC, the safety contour shown is default to the next deeper contour.

- If the safety contour in use becomes unavailable due to a change in the source data, the next deeper contour shown on the chart becomes the default safety contour.

- No ENC available - if the area covered by the ECDIS display includes waters for which no ENC at a scale appropriate for navigation is available.

Important indication - marking of an operational status of displayed information which needs special attention, for example, information with low integrity or invalid information.

Important Indications may be displayed in different places on the ECDIS task screen.

Important indications related to the chart information are displayed in the top left corner of the Chart panel in black against the yellow background.

The following important indications are displayed here:

- Overscale - if the own ship position is covered by an ENC whose original scale is smaller than the current scale of the ECDIS screen.

- SF CNT - if the graphical indication of the detected dangers on Chart panel is turned off (cleared HighlightDanger checkbox in the Antigrounding alerts group on the Safety Alerts page of the Monitoring panel), and monitoring of a safety contour, navigational hazards or some IMO area is also off (cleared Safety contour, Nav. hazards checkboxes in the Antigrounding alerts group and IMO areas tab on the Safety Alerts page of the Monitoring panel);

- Overlap - if there is overlapping of two or more ENC cells of the same usage band.

- ENC permit expired - if the installed ENC permit has expired (the chart number is specified in the hint).

- ENC expires in less than 30 days - if the loaded chart(s) permit(s) expires within the next 30 days.

- ENC cancelled - if the installed ENC has been cancelled (the chart number is specified in the hint).

- Chart information not up to date - if the installed ENC is not up to date (the chart number is specified in the hint).

- Non-ENC data - if SENC data from a non-HO source is in use.

- Larger ENC - if a larger scale chart than that in use, is available for the vessel position.

- Display Not Real Time - if the viewing date or date range does not match the current date.

Important indications connected with selection of the Standard Display are shown on the STD DISP selection button in the Operational window of the Control panel.

Important indications connected with the position and gyro offset are shown in a relevant window on the Control panel in the form of a special symbol: a yellow triangle.

Important indications connected with selecting the DR and EP modes for the positioning system are shown in the Primary and Secondary windows by the positioning source name growing yellow.

####### Notifications

Notifications are used to inform the user of some event not directly related to navigation and not regulated by standards.

Notifications are displayed in the top right corner of the Chart panel.

The MFD implements the following notifications:

- AIS Long Range.

- AIS message.

- AIS route active time.

- End of Watch.

- IMO No changed.

- MMSI No changed.

- Time zone changed.

##### Risk Assessment for ECDIS Associated Hazards

###### Introduction

Below information provides guidance for the risk assessment process, for use of ECDIS.

###### Hazard Examples

The master fails to ensure that appropriate nautical charts and nautical publications are available to plan the intended voyage prior to proceeding to sea (in accordance with SOLAS V), leading to the possibility of one or more of the following:

- Certain charts and publications required to properly appraise the intended voyage are not available

- Information essential to vessel's navigational safety is missing from the voyage plan

- Certain ENCs necessary for the intended voyage are not held onboard and/or licensed for use

- Permits for other ENCs, which will be used during the intended voyage, will expire before the voyage is completed

- If required to operate in raster chart display system (RCDS) mode, the appropriate portfolio of paper charts is incomplete, and resulting in non-compliance with statutory regulations and potential concerns over the vessel's seaworthiness.

The master fails to ensure that the latest information is considered and/or included in the voyage plan, the voyage being at risk of insufficient appraisal and planning with respect to safety issues, and resulting in:

- The ENCs for the intended voyage not being up-to-date, and/or

- Temporary and preliminary notices to mariners not taken into account, and/or

- Potential confusion arising from discrepancies between ENCs, paper charts and nautical publications, and/or

- Non-compliance with statutory regulations and concerns over the vessel's seaworthiness.

The master and deck officers fail to recognize the limitations of accuracy of some ENCs (and other charts); leading to:

- A misperception that because the ENC data is in a digital format, and the ECDIS is linked to GNSS, everything displayed on the ECDIS screen is complete and accurate.

- A misunderstanding of the purpose of the CATZOC (category of zone of confidence in the survey data) attribute.

- A failure to find and/or understand other horizontal accuracy information.

- Over-zooming the ENC.

- A failure to find and/or understand vertical datum information used to quote the heights and elevations of physical features and the vertical clearances for overhead obstructions.

- A failure to recognize that tidal stream information may be missing from ENCs and resulting in:

- Appropriate horizontal and vertical clearances not set for the voyage, and/or

- Over-confidence in the quality of the ENC data, and/or

- Acceptance of potentially unsafe horizontal and vertical safety margins in respect of navigational hazards derived from old, incomplete and/or inaccurate surveys.

The master and deck officers fail to appreciate the limitations of ENCs and their display on ECDIS, leading them to misuse the system for voyage appraisal, planning, execution and monitoring, and potentially resulting in:

- Difficulty in seeing small Land areas in small-scale ENCs and the possibility that such features may not activate an alarm, if the planned route crosses them, during route checking and execution, and/or

- Reported shoals may not display or activate an alarm in standard display mode, and/or

- Anchorage and terminal names may not be easily displayed, and/or

- Some text notes may be truncated, and/or

- Confusion may be caused by the way the same information is displayed differently on other ENCs, and/or

- Confusion may be caused by the way the same ENC information is displayed differently on systems from other ECDIS manufacturers, and/or

- Routes being unnecessarily constrained by display of isolated danger symbols, and/or

- Difficulty in inspecting all ENC notes.

The master and deck officers misunderstand the ECDIS display settings, leading to:

- Inappropriate setting of display parameters, and/or

- Overcrowded display, and/or

- Significant information being left off the display, and/or

- Significant information being obscured by overlays, and/or

- Over-scaled ENCs being used, and/or

- A failure to use the pick report and resulting in:

- Information which may have significant navigation implications being missed, misunderstood or not considered and/or

- A potentially unsafe route being planned

The user-defined safety settings have not been properly applied in the ECDIS, leading to an inadequately appraised and planned voyage plan, and resulting in:

- The ECDIS's anti-grounding, off-track and look-ahead safety features being compromised, and/or

- The vessel inadvertently standing into unsafe water, and/or

- The vessel being denied access to water which could, in reality, be safely used but has be wrongly designated as "unsafe" and/or

- Alarms failing to activate, and/or ECDIS user distraction caused by a multiplicity of false alarms.

The master fails to ensure that the ECDIS voyage plan contains sufficient detail, leading to an inadequate and incomplete plan, and resulting in:

- Safety contour/safety depth, off-track and look-ahead values improperly set for voyage legs, and/or

- Opportunities for cross-checking missed, and/or

- Changes of operational mode e.g. ENC to RNC/paper not identified, and/or

- ECDIS user unaware of the need to take certain actions, and/or

- ECDIS user not prompted by the system to take certain actions.

The master fails to ensure that the voyage plan has been properly checked, leading to the possibility that:

- The intended route has been planned across the vessel's safety contour, and/or

- The route passes closer than the user-specified safe passing distance to one or more geographical features for which special conditions exist, and resulting in a potentially unsafe route being used for the vessel's navigation.

The master and deck officers become over-reliant on ECDIS, through a failure to appreciate the limitations of ECDIS as a navigational tool. Improper use of certain ECDIS functions, system limitations, including those of any input sensors (e.g. GNSS, log, gyro, AIS), hydrographic data inaccuracies, limitations of ENCs and raster charts and the potential risk of human error result in:

- Not keeping a proper look-out, and/or

- Not performing periodic cross-checking, especially of the vessel's position, by ECDIS-independent methods, and/or

- Inadequately briefing when handing over the navigational watch

The ECDIS software has not been updated in accordance with IMO requirements. The ability of the application software within the ECDIS is compromised and does not work fully in accordance with the performance standards to display all the relevant digital information contained within the ENC and potentially resulting in a failure to:

- Correctly display the latest chart features, and/or

- Activate the appropriate alarms and indications even though the features have been included in the ENC, and/or

- Decrypt or properly authenticate ENCs encrypted to IHO S-63 data protection standard, and/or

- Load or install encrypted ENCs, and/or

- Meet the chart carriage requirements set out in SOLAS V.

The ECDIS, with radar and/or ARPA and/or AIS overlays, is being used by OOWs as the primary means of collision avoidance, potentially leading to risk of collision being determined on limited information, especially insufficient radar information, and resulting in a breach of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, as amended.

The voyage plan has not been updated following the master-pilot exchange, leading to the bridge team being unable to properly monitor the vessel's progress and resulting in the team being less able to properly deal with unexpected events and a potential port state control deficiency due to a variation between the vessel's planned and actual tracks.

Insufficient or inadequate information has been used in appraising the voyage, leading to a plan which is potentially flawed through features posing a hazard to navigation being overlooked, resulting in a breach of the company's safety management system requirement to comply with mandatory rules and regulations (SOLAS V) and take account of applicable codes, guidelines and standards recommended by the IMO (Guidelines on Voyage Planning).

The master and deck officers become over-reliant on the convenience of continuous, automatic position-fixing from a global satellite navigation system receiver (e.g. GPS), leading to a failure to cross-check the vessel's position periodically by independent means or a failure to recognize problems with the integrity of the satellite-derived positional information, and potentially resulting in the vessel running aground.

The master and deck officers are unsure of the meanings of certain symbols used to convey information contained within the ENC, potentially leading to decisions affecting the vessel's safety being taken on an incomplete appraisal, and resulting in the vessel:

- Breaching mandatory rules and regulations relating to reporting and routeing
 systems, areas to be avoided, prohibited areas and other areas for which special conditions apply, and/or

- Running aground, and/or

- Striking fixed or floating objects.

V.F.S. – CH. OFF. - Folder 4 “Work Permits” – Hard Copy Format

RISK ASSESSMENT GUIDELINE

C    x     L    =   R

##### Licenses and Permits

###### Introduction

ENC licenses are produced by the relevant government authorized hydrographic office to limit access to those charts that users are authorized to operate.

The License is system specific for each ECDIS and the license number is used to order additional charts for that system.

Encrypted ENCs require a chart specific permit to use in the system.

Each chart Permit is associated with the license for a particular system.

You can receive the permit:

- Via E-Navigation supplier gateway

- By email

Permit is updated

- To reflect changes in permit permissions or

- When new charts

- New editions of charts are published.

Install only the most recent permits on the system.

The vessel may carry more ENCs than they have permits.

Activate inactive ENC’s by obtaining additional permits.

Use this procedure for activating necessary charts in case of:

- Diversion

- Emergency

- Change of destination

###### Obtaining License or Permits

Request permit updates early, on the required media and for specific voyage.

Record the expiry dates of licenses and permits

Do renewals in a timely manner

All navigating officers shall know the procedure to activate additional charts

##### Manual Corrections on ENC

Create and display additional S-52 objects as manual corrections on the chart, for in force navigation warnings, T&Ps etc.

Manual corrections may be:

- Applied to ENCs

- Interrogated

- Edited

- Moved

- Deleted

- Copied to disc

Manual Corrections are not removed following an update.

###### Manual correction on ENCs - Guidance

Insert Navarea warnings, affecting area of navigation, received via Sat-C or service provider using manual correction.

Record manual corrections input using form ECDIS 04 - Manual Corrections Log.

Note:	To delete information that is no longer valid

Remove the warning when it is cancelled.

###### Deleting Charts - ENC

The 2nd officer alone is authorized by the master to delete charts on ECDIS.

Consult master before deleting charts from the ECDIS.

Note:	This ensures the integrity of the chart portfolio.

##### ECDIS Display Configuration

ECDIS provides four modes to display the information:

- Base display – not intended for safe navigation

- Standard display – contains information when a SENC is first displayed on ECDIS. The displayed information may not be sufficient for safe navigation.

- Custom Display – configured by mariner for route planning or route monitoring

- Full display- displays all layers of the ENC

Caution: Do not use Base or Standard display alone for safe navigation.

Displaying layers may differ between navigational environments such as:

- Pilotage

- Coastal

- Deep sea

- Anchoring situations

Display the following layers under any navigation condition:

- IMO standard display, plus

- Depth soundings & contours

- Wrecks, obstruction & danger marks

- Lights characteristics (at night)

Additionally, while anchoring display also:

Submarine cables & pipelines.

Seabed characteristics

Anchorage identification.

Customization of layers (if required) apart from above mentioned should be as per master’s discretion & standing orders.

Switch to “Full Display” when the vessel is due to breach the limiting boundaries of the XTC or safety contour, the manual safety contour or whenever the risk of missing navigational data could jeopardize safe navigation.

Caution - OOW should be aware that switching on all layers on “Full Display” mode will lead to excessive data cluttering of ECDIS. In this case the manning level should be increased, and Master should be called immediately.

Configure the ECDIS correctly regarding:

- The Route

- Safety depth

- Safety contour

- Safety frame

- Alarms

- Displayed Data

Use form ECDIS 03 to configure the system.

Alter the configuration depending on the area of navigation.

Note:	Consult the master, for approval

ECDIS displays are provided with preset modes depending on the time of day, as follows:

- Day

- Dusk

- Night

OOW should use, as far as practicable one of these modes, whichever is suitable.

Display settings shall be part of the Changeover the Watch procedure.

Use form ECDIS 02 for guidance of display settings to be used during day and night conditions.

##### Limiting Danger Lines

###### Introduction

The ECDIS highlights a given safety contour based on a set safety depth.

Note: the calculated safety depth value should be entered in both “safety depth” and “safety contour” setting.

When safety frame is activated, the system will alarm when in contact with the safety contour, and again when in contact with the first safety depth value encountered.

Note:	Giving prior warning of the proximity of danger

In most of cases the operator is unable to harmonise the safety contour with the safety depth due to lack of contour data available within ENCs.

For example, if the safety depth value is set to 13 m, the system will automatically highlight the next available contour, which is normally higher than safety depth value (i.e. if a safety contour is not available for 13 m).

If the vessel has to proceed over soundings of less than 15 m but greater than 13 m, safe areas cannot be defined.

The system will continuously alarm causing alarm fatigue.

Likewise, visual representation of the ENC would not give operator a clear image of safe and unsafe waters, all navigation area having the same color shade.

In such case, as described above, follow procedure given in “Limiting Danger Lines Guidance” below.

###### Limiting Danger Lines Guidance

The OOW shall follow these guidelines.

Calculate the safety depth value of the LDL as follows:

Safety depth = draught + squat + effect of environmental conditions + (UKC) ­ height of tide

Effect of environmental conditions is a sum of factors as follows:

- Changes to ship’s draft:

- Effect of waves and swell (rolling / pitching) – estimated by Master

- Changes in water density (fresh – brackish – sea)

- Effect of hog/sag

- Observer or instrument error when reading/calculating the draft, etc.

- Changes to water depth due to:

- Predominant weather

Note:	Estimated by master or information found in sailing directions

- Atmospheric conditions

- Reliability of data

- coral growth (see Mariner’s Handbook)

- River estuaries or deltas

- Age of bottom survey

- Obstructions

- Reliability of data – Cross-check CATZOC on ENC by using ‘information’ feature

- Tide level – include if passage through an area is tide dependent

Note: If taking the tide into consideration, an LDL is time dependent because it is based upon the height of tide.

Draw a manual alarmable line and reduce the safety contour setting to the next available contour below the original setting:

Advantages:

- Vessel navigates within the safe area outside the manual alarmable no-go line

- Reduces the number of unnecessary alarms, thus reducing alarm fatigue

- Anti-grounding alarm activates when the look-ahead zone (the Safety Frame) breaches the manual alarmable no-go line drawn at the required safety contour setting

Disadvantages:

- Need to enter the safety contour setting below the value required as per UKC calculation (i.e. the safety contour which is automatically selected by ECDIS when the “safety depth” value is inserted)

- Generic isolated danger marks between the lowered safety contour and the manually drawn no-go line may not show up, depending upon their depths

Revert the safety contour to a value greater than the safety depth, when LDL is no longer required.

Plan the LDL in advance, when presenting the route to the master.

Detail the value of the LDL in the bridge order book or display it on the ECDIS console.

##### Predictor

###### Introduction

The Predictor is a navigation aid to be used for continuous dynamic ship’s position prediction.

###### Using Predictor Guidance

The OOW shall follow these guidelines.

Activate the Predictor function to display the future positions of own ship’s contour.

Configure the Predictor to a set distance or time ahead of the vessel.

The prediction is normally based upon:

- The heading

- Course Over Ground

- Speed Over Ground

- Rate of turn

Use it to:

- Predict the future track of the vessel under current dynamic data

- Gauge the effectiveness of turns

Note:	 The Predictor is only a guide and does not replace the need to verify progress of turns by visual means.

##### Copying and Saving Information

Save the prepared route to reuse or to upload and use in another system

If fitted with multiple systems connected by LAN, then update between systems by transferring data such as:

- Routes

- Additional Information

- Manual Corrections

WARNING!

Do not transfer voyage specific data between ships.You may activate a route that has not been planned as per these procedures or use data not specific to the ship, placing the ship in danger.

##### Use of ECDIS for Navigation

###### Over Reliance on ECDIS

Be aware of the danger of over reliance on single sources of information

Caution!	Do not ignore information indicating that the ship is standing into danger when the ECDIS position indicates the ship is safe or vice versa.

Use at least two independent methods to seek confirmation of:

- The ship's position relative to the planned track or hazards

- The distance-to-run to wheel over (see Annex A) or critical point

Operate the ECDIS only after proper training and familiarization

Note:	Using ENC data may prove dangerous if inadequate training and familiarization has been given.

ECDIS may not display some isolated shoal depths when operating in ‘base’ or ‘standard display’ mode.

ECDIS display modes that are set-up in ‘base’ display mode may remove vital information.

Route planning and monitoring alarms may not be activated when approaching dangers and may result in groundings.

Set up the ECDIS display as per the environment the ship is operating in.

Layers of data may need to be added or removed depending on the situation (see “ECDIS Display Configuration” section above).

###### Proving ECDIS Correct

Make full use of RIO (RADAR Information Overlay) checks, if available.

- Take manual fixes when possible to check the accuracy of primary and, where fitted, secondary position source positions.

- Assess the validity of the primary and secondary position source data by comparing the vessel track display history against manual fixes at particular times.

- Check if ECDIS is correct or whether a discrepancy exists.

- Use the EBL/VRM in offset mode to measure the fix's range and direction from the track time-mark.

- If you have any doubt or discrepancy, report to the master.

Take the following precautions when applying manual fixes:

- Display ship’s track or track history

- If GNSS is set as the primary position input, then manual fixes will not affect the ship position

- If DR/EP mode is the primary position input, accepted operator fixes will determine the ship position

Note:	Check manual fix for accuracy prior to accepting the position.

Check the accuracy of GNSS at intervals shown below:

- During ocean navigation, if possible, the interval between cross-check fixes should not be greater than 60 minutes

- During coastal navigation, the interval between cross-check fixes should be at the discretion of master and recorded in the passage plan.

- Carry out RIO alignment check with the coastline during and at appropriate intervals between fixes

Use the following methods to cross-check the ECDIS position during ocean navigation:

- Monitor the primary vessel track against the secondary vessel track, specifically check each fix

- If available and within range, use radar fix or using RIO, as the primary method to cross-check fixes

Use the following methods to cross-check the ECDIS position during Coastal Navigation:

- Monitor the primary vessel track against the secondary vessel track, specifically check each fix

- If available and within range, use radar fix or visual observation, as the primary method to cross-check fixes

- If available, use RIO as a good method to crosscheck accuracy of GPS/GNSS

- Plot manual fixes at the required intervals

###### Radar Overlay

Positions of other vessels and targets displayed on the ECDIS might be obscured because of improperly tuned radars or improperly set anti-clutter on either the radar or ECDIS.

####### Use of Radar Information Overlay (RIO) to Support Fixing Position

Display the RIO during ocean navigation and coastal navigation to cross-check fixes.

Set the RIO at an appropriate color and transparency.

Enable assessment of correlation between coastline and the RIO:

- Without causing excessive clutter

- Covering safety critical information

Where the radar overlay indicates a possible error in displayed position (i.e. radar displays out of alignment with the chart) the OOW should seek and alternative fix method to re-establish a safe navigation position and a check on why satellite positioning system may be in error.

Caution!	Do not switch-over from one radar over to the other radar overlay without master’s authorization.

####### Using Guard Zone Guidance

Use the guard zone function to detect and alarm for approaching ARPA and AIS targets

Note:	This may duplicate alarms between the ECDIS and the radar and increase the workload.

###### Collision Avoidance

Caution!	Do not use ECDIS or AIS as a collision avoidance tool.

An ECDIS equipped with a radar overlay must only be used as a situational awareness tool during anti-collision maneuvers and not for primary anti-collision purposes. Instead, use the ship’s automated radar plotting aid (ARPA) radars for this purpose.

While CPA / TCPA information will be identical on both equipment, only an ARPA radar set to “speed through the water” with gyro inputs, will provide a much closer representation of the actual target aspect, allowing proper adherence to collision regulations.

Caution!	Do not use ECDIS as a substitute for radar. Do not use AIS as a substitute for ARPA.

###### Use of Admiralty Information Overlay (AIO)

The admiralty information overlay is a service provided by the United Kingdom hydrographic office (UKHO).

The ADMIRALTY Information Overlay is a dataset designed to be displayed over ENCs and which contains all ADMIRALTY T&P NMs. The overlay carries information where appropriate ADMIRALTY paper chart coverage is available. Where there is no corresponding paper chart coverage “No Overlay“ feature will be displayed. In these areas users should consult appropriate local sources of information.

In addition to T&P NMs, the UKHO makes available within the AIO differences that it identifies between ADMIRALTY paper charts and ENCs, these are referred to as EPNMs. They can include information on reported hazards to navigation, which have been incorporated into the ADMIRALTY paper chart but not yet in the appropriate ENC, as well as discrepancies between the paper chart and the ENC which are in the process of being resolved.

UKHO publishes a list of countries in AVCS, and whether they have confirmed that they publish temporary information in their ENCs. ADMIRALTY only produce T&P NMs where there is a paper chart coverage.

Information that is relevant to the voyage should be transferred from the AIO and incorporated via “manual correction” and the same should be recorded in ECDIS 04 – Manual Correction Log

The service provides:

- Admiralty temporary and preliminary notices to mariners and

- Additional navigationally significant information from the UKHO ENC validation programme

Note:	As a single layer overlay on top of the basic ENC.
The operator can show or hide this layer as necessary.

Make use of this service:

- For route planning

- To view the latest T&P information on ENCs

Company vessels are subscribed to AIO service.

The table below shows ways of displaying object classes on the Chart Panel.

Note:	For the AIO charts to be displayed, the ENC charts which they are attached to should be installed!

##### ECDIS Safety Functions

Navigation in areas crowded with dangers to navigation requires permanent monitoring.

Chart objects are identified by the ECDIS as dangers to navigation by certain safety parameters set by the operator.

Three contours can be set together with a means of emphasizing spot depths.

If the values you enter do not correspond to a contour available in the chart, the next available deeper contour will be used.

Note:	If the chart on display has 10 m and 20 m contours and you have set your safety depth at 11 m, the 20 m contour will be used as the safety contour.

Configure the below safety functions to alarm and warn if the vessel is approaching shoal waters or other hazards to navigation:

- Safety depth

- Safety contour

- Safety frame

- Other safety functions in ECDIS

ECDIS does not give a spurious alarm.

OOW must acknowledge alarms and warnings.

###### Safety Frame

Use the safety frame to set the chart area that will be scanned by the ECDIS for the generation of:

- Anti-grounding alarms

- Area alerts

- Navigation alarms

The safety frame will define the trigger points for alarms and warnings projected ahead, port and starboard of the vessel.

Set the safety frame to allow the OOW sufficient time to avoid the danger, once detected, based on:

- Size

- Maneuverability

- Speed of vessel

Following settings are recommended for use in pilotage and confined waters (vessel dependent):

- Ahead: 3 mins

- Port: 0.1 nm

- Starboard: 0.1 nm

Note:	In a confined channel where a vessel will always be very close to shoal waters, it may be appropriate to reduce the recommended settings in order to avoid excessive alerts.

Following settings are recommended for use in coastal waters (vessel dependent):

- Ahead: 6 mins

- Port: 0.2 nm

- Starboard: 0.2 nm

Following settings are recommended for use in open ocean (vessel dependent):

- Ahead: 15 mins

- Port: 0.5 nm

- Starboard: 0.5 nm

The Safety Frame settings shall be reassessed in CATZOC areas that have reduced position accuracy such as B, C, D, U, to ensure that the vessel has sufficient safety margin.

Safety Frame shall be always displayed.

The captain should use his prerogative to modify the safety frame settings.

Agree to the safety frame setting when plan is approved.

Caution!	 The safety frame should always be displayed so the operator can see what is triggering an alarm or warning indication!

Record the settings in form NAV 04A, to use during navigation. Record on the form the time and place where the safety settings have been changed.

###### Safety Depth

Set the safety depth to detect depths that are a danger to navigation.

Note:	If the Safety Frame crosses over such a danger, the navigation danger alarm shall be triggered.

Note:	ECDIS highlights a depth equal to or less than the safety depth on the chart in black bold figures, when the display of spot soundings is turned on.

Plan the safety depth values for various stages of the voyage during the planning phase.

Set the safety depth to the ship's draught plus under keel clearance as per the company’s policy.

Compare safety depth to a critical depth and set as follows:

- Safety depth = draught + squat + effect of environmental conditions + safety (UKC) ­ HoT (Height of Tide)

where “effect of environmental conditions” is a sum of factors that may affect the vessel or the sea bottom, as follows:

- Changes to ship’s draft:

- Effect of waves and swell (rolling / pitching) – estimated by master

- Changes in water density (fresh – brackish – sea)

- Effect of hog/sag

- Observer or instrument error when reading/calculating the draft, etc.

- Changes to water depth

- Changes in water depth due to predominant weather – estimated by master or information found in sailing directions

- Changes due to atmospheric conditions

- Reliability of data – coral growth (see Mariner’s Handbook), changes in bottom due to river estuaries or deltas, age of bottom survey, obstructions, etc.

- Reliability of data – CATZOC must be always cross-checked with additional information related to depths and soundings given in the ENC Chart Information section that can be accessed by using the of information feature (the “i” virtual button).

Note: Configure the safety depth and safety contour values correctly.

###### Safety Contour

The set value of safety contour distinguishes between safe and unsafe water.

It generates alarms and warnings when the contour is crossed by the Safety Frame.

By default, the safety contour is set at 30 m.

The safety contour is displayed on the ENC with a bold line.

If due to change of chart under the ship position the previously selected safety contour becomes unavailable, the safety contour alarm is generated.

Note:	In this case, the system will set the safety contour as equal to a deeper available depth contour.

Determine the safety depth and safety contour required to give the necessary under keel clearance.

Discuss the safety contour for a particular route at the briefing stage.

State the safety depth and safety contour in the navigation plan.

The safety depth and safety contour data is part of the watch handover and is displayed on all ECDIS units.

Calculate the safety contour and safety depth considering all factors.

Once approved by the master, record the information regarding the safety settings in NAV 04A and inform the bridge team.

###### The Isolated Danger Symbol

As with paper charts, ENCs include details of various types of underwater features which may pose a danger to navigation. This includes features such as wrecks, rocks, and other types of obstructions such as wellheads, fish havens and diffusers.

The new and conspicuous symbol, shown right, is displayed where one of these features is known to have a depth less than or equal to the safety contour value entered by the user, and sits in the deeper waters beyond the safety contour as depicted by the ECDIS (i.e. it is a hazard to navigation located in otherwise “safe waters”).

Note:	This isolated danger symbol is only applied to wrecks, rocks and obstructions that are submerged. It is not applied to soundings. The symbol most commonly represents a point feature, but will appear in the center for obstructions which are area features (e.g. foul area).

Caution! Whilst not all danger features have depth values defined, mariners should take due care whenever encountering an isolated danger symbol. The ECDIS pick report should be used in each case to confirm whether the feature poses a real danger to the vessel.

###### Shallow and Deep Contour

The shallow and deep contours are for information purposes only.

Use the deep contour for example, to display the contour that can have significance to navigation, like squat, starting of echo sounder etc.

The shallow and deep contours provide the following:

Shallow contour ­ shades the area from the shallow contour to zero depth

Deep contour ­ shades the area below the deep contour (above is white).

If correctly configured, the following depth information is shaded and distinguishable from each other:

- Zero to shallow contour (dark blue)

- Shallow contour to safety contour (light blue)

- Safety contour to deep contour (light grey)

- Greater than deep contour (white)

If four shades is not selected, then two shades are displayed as below:

- Zero to safety contour (blue)

- Greater than safety contour (white)

Use the two shades setting when navigating using the dusk or night palette as the contrast between safe and unsafe water and ARPA and AIS targets is improved.

Use the following guideline for sake of uniformity within the fleet:

- Deep contour - set to 50 m

- Safety depth - set in accordance with calculation method described above

- Safety contour – set equal to safety depth

- Shallow contour – set to 2 m

###### Wheel Over Line (WOL) Guidance

Wheel Over Line (WOL) is a line upon crossing which it is necessary to angle the rudder to turn in to the next leg of the route; The WOL is generally parallel to the next route leg. The exception is formed by an acute (< 30°) or obtuse (> 150°) angle between the adjacent route legs, as well as by the route’s end point.

To calculate properly the Wheel over Line the ECDIS is taking into consideration two values which have to be set properly by the operator Turning radius and F-distance.

Turn radius (Turn radius arc) is as shown on the figure on the right an arc of the set radius (Turn Radius) circle inscribed in the angle between two adjacent route legs (used for the display of the approximate ship track on a turning circle). Turn radius should be set for each leg of the route in the passage plan stage.

Note: 	Calculate the turning radius using formula: R = (Speed / ROT) x 0.96

F-distance (forwarding distance) is the distance between the position where a helm order is given and the position where the vessel actually starts turning On the figure below it is shown how it affects the WOL position.

The F-distance should be calculated or obtained from the maneuvering characteristics by each vessel for the following stages: Loaded / Medium / Ballast condition and the values should be applied in the Task List menu Config panel, General page , ship condition group.

F-distance is used as well in route planning, Curved Heading Line, Track Control etc.

###### Route cross-track settings

Set the cross-track deviation along the passage depending of the area of navigation.

Recommended settings are:

- Open Ocean – cross-track set to 1.0 NM port / starboard

- Coastal waters – cross-track set to 0.5 NM port / starboard

- Confined waters/pilotage /restricted waters – cross-track set to cover the entire width of the safe navigation channel (e.g. the entire width of the TSS or Fairway, etc..)

Note: this setting is necessary to ensure that the vessel will not exit the limits of the validated route in case a deviation is necessary while sailing in restricted waters.

Discuss any changes to these settings with master.

###### Scale in Use

Like paper charts, every ENC cell is assigned compilation scale by the ENC producer. This is the ECDIS display scale which the ENC cell is intended to be used for navigation and provides the ECDIS with a reference point from which it can calculate various scale warnings.

####### Zooming In to a Larger Scale

Displaying a zoomed-in chart increases the risk of running too close to danger.

The ability of ECDIS to zoom in to a scale larger than the compilation scale of the paper chart, whilst displayed symbol stay the same size, can give a false sense of sea room and safety.

It is not recommended to navigate using ENC cell zoomed in to a larger scale.

As soon as the ECDIS is zoomed in so that the ENC cell is displayed larger than its compilation scale, a warning message should appear confirming that the ENC data is no longer used at its recommended scale.

####### Zooming Out to a Smaller Scale

There will be occasions where it is appropriate to display ENC data at smaller than its compilation scale (i.e. zoomed out). Compressing the same data into a smaller area introduces the problem that the display may become too cluttered such that important navigational information becomes obscured from view.

Remain aware of the true chart scale vs. the zoom facility.

When using the radar overlay, the relationship between the displayed chart area and the radar scale in use is approximately:  Chart scale 1:10,000 = 0.75 NM   /   Chart scale 1:20,000 = 1.50 NM

###### Scamin

Scamin is an optional attribute used to de-clutter the chart display by suppressing some chart features above a certain display scale.

Scamin may affect the display as it removes information if best scale ENC is not being used (i.e. safety critical information may be removed from the display), therefore the system must be set to operate with Scamin “off” for appraisal, planning and review phases to ensure all information is seen.

When Scamin function is in use, navigators should always check the passage plans at ‘compilation scale’ during route monitoring.

Select auto-load and auto-scale on the compilation scale of the chart or 1:1 and frequently check that this setting is correct.

Note:	Above figure shows how setting a spot sounding removes unnecessary depths from the chart, thereby reducing chart clutter.

###### Selection of Sensors

ECDIS displays position from variety of sources:

- A primary position source

- A secondary position source

- Manual inputs

ECDIS shall use as primary sensors:

- GNSS – for position

- Gyro – for heading

- Speed Log – for speed through the water

- Echo Sounder – for depth

If possible, display both the primary and secondary position sources.

Configure the divergence alarm to alert the OOW of any significant differences between the two sources.

Select the preferred sensor source with regard to:

- Heading

- Depth

- Speed

- Wind

- ARPA

- Radar

If any degradation of sensors is observed:

- Report to master

- Select the most accurate secondary sensor

Overlay routes and map data on the radar avoiding excessive clutter.

###### Man Overboard - ECDIS

In the case of a man overboard (MOB), press the MOB icon or shortcut key.

Note:	This initiates the input of a reference point in ECDIS.
Also provides a constant range and bearing from the ship.

If the MOB is not being tracked visually, use ECDIS to direct the lookout bearing.

Note:	The system may not account for the set and drift for the position of the MOB.

Activate the MOB marker soonest after MOB entering the water.

Note:	The location of the MOB marker can be offset.

Estimate the position of the MOB from the primary vessel track history.

Offset the position of the MOB to this new position.

Note:	The MOB function may not provide a prediction of set and drift.
OOW should check tidal information.

###### Virus Protection

Caution!	ECDIS do not have virus protection and are therefore prone to attack. An infected ECDIS could lead to catastrophic failure of the system.

Restrict use of USB to a single USB that is only used within the LAN.

Check USB sticks and CDs for virus prior to inserting into ECDIS.

Make sure that a robust system exists and that all operators are briefed accordingly.

###### Software Updates

Install only software updates, including updates to the S-52 presentation library, provided by the manufacturer.

Test the software on all ECDIS.

Record the update.

###### ECDIS Data Recording

ECDIS automatically records voyage data during use.

Configure the settings as required to provide as comprehensive a picture as possible of the past track of the ship.

Caution!	Do not play-back navigational data on the bridge ECDIS while under way.

The Second Officer should:

- Back up log data for archive purposes on a monthly basis

- Back up radar data on a weekly basis

- Copy the logs to an external HDD or USB drive

- Lable clearly and sequentially

- Keep on board until called for

In the event of a navigational incident developing:

- Take ECDIS screenshots if possible

- Back up the relevant playback files immediately

Caution! 	Do not be distracted or prejudiced in dealing with the incident.

Note:	If unable to get a screenshot during an incident, then immediately following any incident or near miss, save a screenshot to disc from all bridge terminals. This is to assist in any subsequent investigation or enquiry. The investigating team to can observe how each terminal was configured, and therefore what each user was seeing at the time.

###### Backup Procedure

The 2nd officer shall back up, at beginning every voyage data such as:

- Routes

- Additional Information

- Manual corrections

- Logbook

- Other relevant ECDIS data

Do the back-up on a dedicated external HDD or USB drive.

The data can be overwritten during the next back-up.

Note:	This will serve as a record in the event of ECDIS failure, loss of data or inadvertent deletion of data.

##### ECDIS Maintenance

The manufacturer provides remote control assistance when required.

The master can contact the customer support line when needed.

After Remote Service is requested, Remote Service Request pop-up window displays the beginning of the service engineer’s message and permits selection of one of the following options:

- Permit access (Confirm button);

- Start a chat with the service engineer (Chat button);

- Deny access for a certain number of minutes (DND button).

If the Confirm button is pressed, a message that the system is in service mode will be displayed. The same window appears if the Confirm button is pressed directly in the Remote Service Request pop-up window without applying to a chat with the service engineer, these buttons are synchronized.

To disallow the service engineer to carry out remote works, press the DND button.

Caution!	It is strongly recommended that maintenance works are not performed when underway, since they may interfere with the MFD operation. If it is necessary to perform the maintenance work underway, Master discretion should be used to verify that it will not impede the safe navigation of the vessel.

To exit from the Remote Service mode, press the Terminate button in the Remote Service pop-up window.

Masters should contact the customer support line from time to time and request updates to ECDIS software installed.

###### Operating Anomalies

All ships using ECDIS should annually carry out data presentation and performance checks.

NP 231 - Annex 6 gives guidance by which mariners may check the ECDIS display for the correct symbols contained in the latest presentation library.

Report to the company for further action any identified anomalies on board on the system:

- Hardware

- Software

- Electronic charts

Slow operation of ECIDS may be experienced.

This can occur due to large amount of data stored in the ECDIS and in to old history, that are engaging significant operational resources and physical memory of both ECDIS stations.

If this is experienced, you should contact E-Navigation supplier that will guide you to:

Move the routes not in use on external drives for future use if necessary

Note:	This can be done only on Master station that will synchronize latter to the Back-up station.

Uninstall expired charts

Uninstall charts that you don’t need

Clean-up the computers using e “Data Tool-Move”, as directed

Transfer past tracks older than 3 months to an external drive

Note:	This must be done separately on each ECDIS workstation

Internal clean-up of computers can be done only remotely by E-Navigation supplier.

Above maintenance will significantly improve the performance of the ECDIS.

###### User Guide

Keep the manufacturer's user guide on the bridge in both hard and soft copy.

Install the soft copy on all bridge computers.

Keep a printed version of the user guide on the bridge.

###### Chart Corrections

The Hydrographic offices of various countries produce official charts and take on the responsibility of maintaining their accuracy.

Corrections made by these offices are available on-line.

ENC updates are provided:

- Via CDs from the provider

- Downloaded from provider’s website

- Via e-mail

Via direct gateway connection between ship’s ECDIS and manufacturer’s servers

###### Date of Survey

The reliability and margin of error of a position-fix must be kept in mind, especially when using charts based on older surveys.

While the GPS-derived position may be accurate, it could be misleading in relation with other charted information.

Therefore, confirm the vessel’s position by various independent means.

###### Input Data

The quality of the output information is only as good as the input.

Routinely check equipment that gives data to the ECDIS, along with their power supplies, such as:

- GPS

- Radar

- Speed log

- Gyro

###### Positions

Investigate any GPS alarms to avoid errors in position and the possibility of the vessel running into danger.

###### Chart Datum

This is normally set at WGS 84 (World Geodetic System measurement).

Set the input from the GPS also to WGS 84, to avoid any apparent position discrepancy.

Insert or apply any offset or shift data.

Use the radar overlay to help align this, but exercise caution.

##### Presentation of Data - CATZOC

Every ECDIS operator should assess the quality of information being viewed. This means ensuring settings and procedures consistently provide full relevant safety and that information is mirrored on both bridge ECDIS terminals.

The OOW must check the datum and update status of the loaded chart.

The OOW should also check all chart cautions, warnings and zone of confidence (ZOC) details for charts in use.

Advice the master and 2nd officer of any relevant hazards or cautions discovered and the necessary navigational caution exercised. Information related to ZOCs is available in the software in the ‘Chart / ENC’ menu.

Note:	Additional information regarding the accuracy of depths is available in the ENC Chart Information section. In addition to the CATZOC Symbol, this section may provide additional guidance referring to depths in the area of navigation. This information can be easily accessed via the virtual information button found in Wartsilla 4000 - “i” – and by selecting the area for which the information is sought.

CATZOC allows a hydrographic authority to encode data against five categories (ZOC A1, A2, B, C, D), with a sixth category (U) for data which has not been assessed. The categorization of hydrographic data is based position accuracy, depth accuracy, and sea floor coverage, as shown in the table below:

To decide on a ZOC category, all conditions outlined in columns 2­4 of the table must be met.

Note: although corrections for CATZOC D and CATZOC U are not officially defined, in practice it can be assumed that the required corrections are at least 10% higher than the ones for CATZOC C; i.e. Corr = (2m + 2.5% x d) x 1.1

Footnotes

The allocation of a ZOC indicates that particular data meets minimum criteria for position and depth accuracy and seafloor coverage defined in this table. Depth and position accuracies specified for each ZOC category refer to the errors of the final depicted soundings and include not only survey errors but also other errors introduced in the chart production procedure. Data may be further qualified by Object Class `Quality of Data' (M_QUAL) sub attributes as follows:

Positional Accuracy (POSACC) and Sounding Accuracy (SOUACC) may be used to indicate that a higher position or depth accuracy has been achieved than defined in this table (e.g. a survey where full sea floor coverage was not achieved could not be classified higher than ZOC B; however if the position accuracy was, for instance, ±15 m, the sub attribute POSACC could be used to indicate this.

Swept areas where the clearance depth is accurately known but the actual seabed depth is not accurately known may be accorded a higher ZOC (i.e. A1 or A2) providing positional and depth accuracies of the swept depth meets the criteria in this table. In this instance, Depth Range Value 1 (DRVAL1) may be used to specify the swept depth. The position accuracy criteria apply to the boundaries of swept areas.

SURSTA, SUREND and TECSOU may be used to indicate the start and end dates of the survey and the technique of sounding measurement.

Position Accuracy of depicted soundings at 95% CI (245 Sigma) with respect to the given datum. It is the cumulative error and includes survey transformation and digitising errors etc. Position accuracy need not be rigorously computed for ZOCs B, C and D but may be estimated based on type of equipment, calibration regime, historical accuracy etc.

Depth accuracy of depicted soundings = a + (b­d)/100 at 95% CI (200 sigma), where d = depth in metres, at the critical depth. Depth accuracy need not be rigorously computed for ZOCs B, C and D but may be estimated based on type of equipment, calibration regime, historical accuracy etc.

Significant sea floor features are defined as those rising above depicted depths by more than:

Depth      Significant feature

< 40 m               2m

> 40 m          10% depth

A full sea floor search indicates that a systematic survey was conducted using detection systems, depth measurement systems, procedures, and trained personnel designed to detect and measure depths on significant sea floor features. Significant features are included on the chart as scale allows. It is impossible to guarantee that no significant feature could remain undetected, and significant features may have become present in the area since the time of the survey.

Typical survey characteristics. These descriptions should be seen as indicative examples only.

Controlled systematic surveys (ZOCs A1, A2 and B) are surveys comprising planned survey lines, on a geodetic datum which can be transformed to WGS84.

Modern survey echo sounder. A high precision, single beam depth measuring equipment, generally including all survey echo sounders designed post­1970.

ZOC A1 and A2 require very high accuracy standards which were rarely, if ever, achieved before the advent of satellite positioning in the 1980s. Therefore, many sea lanes which have been regarded as adequately surveyed for many years may carry a ZOC B classification.

Note:	The ZOC classification attained by a survey is for the survey at the date it was conducted. In areas of mobile seabed the actual seabed may differ markedly from what has been charted, even if the survey is only a few months old.

ZOC U - In the early days of ENC production, hydrographic authorities created ENCs by digitizing the existing paper charts. Although this allowed for a rapid expansion in the numbers of ENC cells that were available, it meant that the compilers creating the ENC did not have to hand all the information required to assess which ZOC classification the different parts of the ENC should have. Rather than expend time researching this information, hydrographic authorities categorized the entire ENC as ZOC U, meaning that the category of the data had not been assessed.

Although this situation is improving, it will be some time before early ENC cells are revisited and have all soundings categorized with an appropriate CATZOC.

##### AIS Input

Automatic Identification System (AIS) signals displayed on the ECDIS are useful for gaining situational awareness.

The AIS may be integrated with both radar and ECDIS where feasible but beware of the risk of confusion between the various targets and their associated information.

AIS information must not be used for collision avoidance.

##### Using ECDIS for Incident Review

ECDIS can store historical records of the ship’s position for up to 90 days. Together with its charting capability, it can play an important part in any navigation incident review.

However, this is only possible if the relevant history has been saved soon after the time of the incident; otherwise, it will be overwritten and lost.

The Master will:

- Make sure that history from the ECDIS is saved immediately after any navigation incident.

- Make sure that bridge officers are familiar with how to save the history.

- Place a notice at the ECDIS to act as a reminder.

- Be aware that repeated use of the save function could overwrite previous saved information.

##### Reference / Records/ Forms

The Second Officer shall keep the following manual records up to date:

- Record of manual corrections (see ECDIS 07 form)

- Chart correction Log for the appropriate paper chart folio

- Receipt and installation of any new Licenses or Permits

- Receipt and loading of any new charts.

###### Guidelines for Other Equipment Failure

####### Main Engine Failure/Loss of Propulsion

The Master shall coordinate the response effort. In case of loss of propulsion, the following actions shall be taken:

OOW:

Immediately inform the Master and C/E.

Take evasive actions to avoid navigational dangers if steering is still available.

Switch on NUC lights/symbols.

Use sound signals as necessary.

Broadcast an urgency message to all ships in the vicinity, if necessary.

Inform VTS, if necessary.

Monitor/check the past track position on ECDIS to assess drift direction and rate.

Continuously evaluate the time required with the current drift pattern until running into danger.

Note: When steerage is still available, consider placing the relative wind on the port or starboard side. This can alter the drift direction up to 60° and gain more sea room for the vessel.

Master:

Consider giving the ship a list or trim to influence the rate and direction of drift.

Consider locking the rudder hard over to the downwind side if you need to change the direction of drift.

Assess the time the vessel needs to drift until the closest navigational danger.

Use thrusters, if available, to influence the drift direction and rate.

Lower the anchor in the water if you are drifting towards imminent danger.

Note: The scope of the chain lowered should be consistent with water depth but not greater than 3 shackles and the stopper engaged. Once the anchor touches the bottom, the anchor dragging effect could slow/stop the ship from drifting.

Note: Use guidelines provided in the publication "Peril at Sea and Salvage – A Guide to Master" to alter the vessel’s drift pattern if necessary (see tables 1 to 5).

Discuss with the C/E the available options (e.g., if the vessel can resume passage at a safe speed at least until clear from dangers).

Inform the office of the failure.

Investigate the availability of towing services in the vicinity.

In case towage is employed, use form EMER 26B – LOF.

Chief Engineer:

Investigate the reason for the loss of propulsion.

Try to restore the operation of the main propulsion, if possible.

Consider cancelling faulty M/E unit(s) and resume sea passage at a safe speed, if possible.

Note: Use EMER 10 Check List in the event of loss of propulsion.

####### Steering Failure

The Master shall coordinate the response effort. In case of loss of steering, the following actions shall be taken:

OOW:

Switch to the alternate steering system/method (e.g., use other system, use other steering motor, use manual steering or NFU mode).

Inform the Master and C/E (Engine Room).

Summon a helmsman immediately if not already on the bridge.

Summon required crew for engaging emergency steering mode (in the steering gear room).

Switch on NUC lights/symbols.

Reduce M/E to manoeuvring RPM.

Broadcast an urgency message to all vessels, if necessary.

Inform VTS, if necessary.

Assess the heading direction and speed.

Check for navigational dangers in the vicinity.

Master:

Stop M/E or reduce speed.

Steer the vessel using the available steering mode (e.g., emergency steering).

If none of the steering modes is available, lock the rudder in a fixed position if possible.

Assess the navigational condition and vicinity of navigational dangers.

Use engines full astern – this could bring the stern of the ship into the weather.

If the rudder is locked hard-over, using the engines carefully could bring the vessel’s head into the weather.

In case of simultaneous loss of propulsion, follow the guidance provided for “Main Engine Failure/Loss of Propulsion”.

Chief Engineer:

Investigate the reason for the failure.

Restore steering gear operation if possible.

Note: Use EMER 08 Check List in the event of steering failure. If simultaneous loss of propulsion is experienced, follow also EMER 10 Check List.

####### Electrical Power Failure

The Master shall coordinate the response effort.

In the event of loss of electrical power (blackout), it is also evident that the vessel would experience a loss of propulsion. Actions described above in “Main Engine Failure / Loss of Power” and in “Steering Failure” are also applicable if this event occurs. In addition, the engine room team shall take the following actions:

Regain emergency power from the Emergency Generator.

Initiate the procedure for recovering functionality after a blackout.

Chief Engineer shall ensure that:

A ship-specific procedure to feedback power from the Emergency Switchboard to the Main Switchboard is available in the ECR.

A ship-specific procedure for the recovery of equipment functionality after a blackout is available in the ECR.

All engine room crew is familiar with the above two procedures and can refer to the posted guidelines/procedures.

Note: Use EMER 09 Electrical Power Failure Check List in conjunction with EMER 08 and EMER 10.

## 4.3 Communications Equipment and Procedures



### 4.3.1 GMDSS equipment and Portable Radios - rev 0 issued 24.10.2024

##### GMDSS and Communication Equipment

###### Introduction

Each vessel over 300 gross tons and upwards on international voyages shall be provided with the GMDSS equipment required by Flag Administration, in accordance with the area of navigation.

The GMDSS provides that every ship, while at sea, shall be able to perform the following nine basic communication functions:

- transmitting ship-to-shore distress alerts (by at least two separate and independent methods);

- receiving shore-to-ship distress alerts.

- transmitting and receiving ship-to-ship distress alerts.

- transmitting and receiving search and rescue coordinating communications.

- transmitting and receiving on-scene communications.

- transmitting and receiving signals for locating.

- transmitting and receiving maritime safety information.

- transmitting and receiving general communications; and

- transmitting and receiving bridge-to-bridge communications.

GMDSS Areas are:

- Sea Area A1: the area within the radio-telephone coverage of at least one VHF coast station in which continuous DSC (Digital Selective Calling) alerting is available.

- Sea Area A2: the area, excluding Sea Area A1, within the radiotelephone coverage of at least one MF coast station in which continuous DSC (Digital Selective Calling) alerting is available.

- Sea Area A3: the area, excluding Sea Areas A1 and A2, within the coverage of an Inmarsat geostationary satellite in which continuous alerting is available; and

- Sea Area A4: an area outside sea areas A1, A2 and A3.

Notes:

Sea Area 1 - ships operating exclusively within about 35 NM from the shore shall carry only equipment for VHF-DSC communications.

Sea Area A2 – ships sailing beyond 35 NM, up to about 150 to 400 NM from shore, should carry both VHF-DSC and MF-DSC equipment.

Sea Area A3 - ships operating further from the shore but within the footprints of the Inmarsat satellites should additionally carry approved Inmarsat terminal(s).

Sea Area A4 - cannot, by definition, be covered by the Inmarsat satellites and so ships operating in those waters – essentially the northern waters of the Arctic region – need to make provision for using HF communications.

GMDSS equipment may be formed by:

- VHF WITH DSC

- MF/HF WITH DSC

- SAT C-1 EGC Receiver (LRIT)

- SAT C-2 EGC Receiver

- NAVTEX

- EPIRB

- SART

- GMDSS WALKIE TALKIE

Every vessel shall be enrolled in a Shore-based Maintenance Agreement to ensure availability and servicing of GMDSS and Navigational equipment.

###### Responsibilities

###### EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon)

EPIRB is a device to alert search and rescue services (SAR) in case of an emergency out at sea.

It is a tracking equipment that transmits a signal on a specified band to locate a lifeboat, life raft, ship or people in distress.

An EPIRB is a Secondary means of DISTRESS alerting, that comes later in the hierarchy of alerting SAR authorities in case of distress.

It is installed on ships and other vessels after being registered with the national search and rescue forces. The registration allows confirmation of false alerts faster and quick rescue operations in case of emergencies.

At least one EPIRB should be carried on board.

EPIRBS under the COSPAS-SARSAT system work on the 406.025 MHz and 121.5 MHz bands and are applicable for all sea areas.

####### Testing/Maintenance

EPIRB shall be tested/maintained on board as per manufacturer's instructions

2nd Officer is designated person in charge of testing/maintaining EPIRB on board.

He should be well familiar with:

- How to conduct monthly self-test for EPIRB without using satellite system

- The procedure to follow should the EPIRB be activated accidentally

- Manual operation of the EPIRB

Annual test should be carried out annual safety radio survey by a shore technician for all aspects of their operational efficiency with particular emphasis on

- Frequency stability,

- Signal strength and coding

- Condition of batteries that shall be replaced at intervals specified by the manufacturer.

- Condition of hydrostatic releases that shall be replaced by their expiry dates.

All checks of electrical parameters should be performed in the self-test mode, if possible. All records of testing/maintenance to be recorded in GMDSS radio logbook. Master & deck officers should be well familiar with the operation of EPIRB.

Caution: If for any reason an EPIRB is activated accidentally, the ship should contact the nearest coast station or an appropriate coast earth station or RCC and cancel the distress alert.

###### SART (Search & Rescue Transponder)

A search and rescue transponder (SART) is a self-contained, waterproof transponder intended for emergency use at sea.

At least 2 SART should be carried on ship of 500 GT & above.

The radar-SART is used to locate a  or distressed vessel by creating a series of dots on a rescuing ship's  display.

SART:

- Is made of fibre-reinforced plastic which can withstand and bear the prolonged exposure to sunlight and extreme weather conditions.

- Is capable of floating free of the survival craft.

- Is mounted on a mounting bracket which is fixed to a bulkhead on a ship, on the bridge.

- It operates on the 9GHz frequency band (9.2 to 9.5 GHz) and generates a series of blips on the radar it is interrogated by (3 cm/X Band radar).

- Is activated manually and hence responds only when interrogated.

- Has an audio or visual indication of its correct operation and informs survivors when interrogated by the radar.

When activated in a distress situation, the SART responds to radar interrogation by transmitting a signal which generates 12 blips on the radar and turns into concentric circles as the range between the two reduces.

SART battery should be operational in standby condition operational for 96 hours & in working condition operational for 8 hours. It should be operable in temperature between -20 deg to 55 deg.

####### Testing/Maintenance

- How a SART transmission would be displayed on a radar screen.

- Required inspection and testing of the SARTs.

- How to conduct monthly self-test of SART as per manufacturer’s instructions

Annual test should be carried out on board during annual safety radio by shore technician.

The test includes:

- checking the availability of type approval certificate.

- checking the validity of batteries and the availability of appropriate labelling (if less than 12 months are left at the time of inspection, replacement of batteries is required).

- checking the location of the radar transponder installation; the photoluminescent IMO symbol “Radar transponder” should be available.

- examining for mechanical damage and protection against unintentional activation.

- checking the operability of the SART within the specified range of 9.2-9.5 GHz.

All records of testing//maintenance to be recorded in GMDSS radio logbook.

Master & deck officers should be well familiar with the operation of SART.

Caution! In case of a false activation, switch the SART off immediately. Transmit a DSC safety alert on VHF Channel 70. Transmit a safety broadcast by RT on VHF Channel 16 to all stations indicating your ID and position and that you wish to cancel your false alert which was transmitted in error.

###### Survival Craft Portable Two-way VHF Radios

At least three two-way VHF radiotelephone apparatus must be provided on every cargo ship of 500 tons gross tonnage and above.

They are usually stored on or near the navigating bridge, for easy transport to survival craft.

The primary battery should have sufficient capacity to ensure 8 hr operation at its highest rated power.

Primary batteries should have a shelf life of at least 2 years, and if identified to be user–replaceable should be of a yellow or orange colour or marking.

Batteries not intended for use in the event of a distress situation should be of a colour or marking such that they cannot be confused with batteries intended for such use.

Brief operating instructions and expiry date for the primary batteries should be clearly indicated on the exterior of the equipment.

  - Note: Survival craft portable two-way VHFs shall not be used for routine (non-emergency) communication. Post instruction note next to the storage location.

####### Testing/Maintenance

2nd Officer is designated person in charge of testing/maintaining all GMDSS equipment on board.

Each survival craft two-way VHF equipment should be tested at least once a month to ensure proper operation and readiness for immediate use in case of emergency situation.

The inspection / maintenance shall cover:

- Testing on a frequency other than VHF channel 16 (156.8 MHz).

- The expiry date of the battery that needs to be checked and changed when required.

- Testing the communication in boat drills with each boat station.

All GMDSS equipment should be tested during the annual safety radio survey by shore technician.

All records of testing//maintenance to be recorded in GMDSS radio logbook.

Master & deck officers should be well familiar with the operation of VHF radios.

###### Navtex

Subject identifiers relevant to current and future requirement are configured in NAVTEX receiver each watch

Outdated information is deleted appropriately

NAVTEX data is selected for display on ECDIS

Check whether any warnings or relevant information has been received

The second officer shall examine the daily imports

Note:	To check for warnings that might apply to the planned voyage.

OOW shall:

- Check all messages received from NAVTEX

- Mark the messages on the paper chart or ECDIS, where relevant to the safety of navigation

- Delete the marks when they are cancelled

If NAVTEX has been integrated with ECDIS. On receipt of a NAVTEX message:

- Highlight the location and coordinates that the message relates to

- Plot the coordinates as required into the right bottom box of the NAVTEX panel

- Select the Polygon checkbox if required

Note: if a danger to navigation is provided by the warning and the location is in the vicinity of the route, a manual correction shall be inserted in lieu of the polygon provided automatically. This applies to spot dangers only.

- Assess if the warning affects the route

Note:	If the coordinates from the NAVTEX message are transferred automatically into the right bottom box of the NAVTEX panel, confirm their accuracy by comparing them with the original NAVTEX message.

- Allocate a danger attribute if necessary

Note:	An alert will be generated when the safety frame comes into contact with the object, if the danger attribute is allocated to it.

- Inform the master and other officers as required

- Change message status to “Examined” to indicate that the message has been read and the location checked

- Protect the message as required to prevent deletion

Note:	If NAVTEX is integrated with ECDIS, paper copies of NAVTEX messages (if available) should be marked as “verified” and kept on the Bridge during the voyage. When the voyage is completed, they shall be archived.

If the NAVTEX is not connected to ECDIS:

- Manually insert received NAVTEX warnings affecting the navigation area on the ECDIS using “manual correction” function:

- Maintain a log of manual corrections in form ECDIS 04

- Remove the warning, when cancelled

- Erase older, obsolete messages from the ECDIS

- Verify and sign the message

Note:	In force warnings will be received again during the next broadcast.

Keep NAVTEX receiver switched ON throughout the period of vessel stay in port

Select to receive messages from a specific station or stations, depending on the vessel’s geographic position

### 4.3.2 AMVER Traffic Reporting Systems - rev 0 issued 24.10.2024

##### AMVER and Other Traffic Reporting Systems

###### Introduction

Participation in AMVER and other voluntary position reporting systems is encouraged.

Responsibilities

The master should participate in AMVER and other voluntary and mandatory vessel reporting systems.

###### Ship Reporting Systems

Ship reporting systems provide Coastal States with notice of the presence of ships within specific waters to better respond to marine emergencies, protect the marine environment, and ensure the safety of life at sea.

Note: Coastal states may require voluntary reporting for all vessels, but it may be mandatory for vessels carrying dangerous goods in bulk or packed form.

Nautical Digital Publications provide the required information and means of transmission of reports to shore-based authorities.

Using the AMVER System Procedure:

AMVER is a voluntary position reporting system operated by the U.S. Coast Guard, aiming to quickly provide SAR authorities with accurate information on the positions and characteristics of vessels near a reported distress.

Vessels should participate in the program when:

- Trading to, from, or between ports in the United States of America.

- Undertaking ocean passages (routes where a vessel does not come within radar range of a major landmass for more than 48 hours).

The preferred method of sending AMVER messages is by email. If not possible, use USCG radio stations or coast radio stations listed in the AMVER bulletin.

Note: Messages sent through these stations are free of charge.

# 05. Safety and Risk Management

## 5.1 Safety Management



### 5.1.1 Safety Culture - rev 0 issued 06.11.2024

##### Safety Culture

Introduction: Safety Culture refers to an organization's approach to managing safety, encompassing both operational procedures and individual attitudes. It consists of:

- Operational Framework: This includes policies, practices, and procedures established by the organization for safety management.

- Individual Mindset: It involves the values, priorities, and motives of employees within the organization.

###### A Just Culture

Reederei Nord adheres to the Just Culture concept.

A just culture encourages people to report mistakes, helping to identify and fix system issues before they cause harm.

It improves safety by empowering employees to monitor and participate in safety efforts. In this culture, both the organization and its staff share responsibility, focusing on reducing risks, improving systems, understanding human behavior, and ensuring safety.

###### Responsibility

The master and senior officers shall develop a "safety culture" on-board, based on the above principle of Just Culture.

The master is responsible for ensuring that safety rounds are conducted, documented correctly, and action taken where necessary.

The senior officers shall regularly check the equipment under their control.

###### Promotion of Safety Behavior

Achieving an effective safety culture demands collective commitment from all levels. Each member, both at sea and onshore, should not only recognize the organization's emphasis on safety but also demonstrate a proactive "Safety First" attitude. Safety promotion initiatives aim to embed a culture where every individual actively contributes to safety through their daily actions and participation in the Safety Management System (SMS).

Work culture is shaped by the beliefs, attitudes, ideologies, and principles of both employees and the organization. It dictates interpersonal dynamics and operational efficiency. A strong work culture is evident when employees adhere to organizational rules and regulations, fostering a cohesive and disciplined environment.

Enhancing Safety: Improving safety entails focusing on three main pillars:

- Facilities and Equipment: Upgrading technology and ensuring reliable equipment enhances safety.

- Systems: Implementing efficient processes and procedures contributes to an improved safety culture.

- People: Promoting good leadership, exemplary behavior, and fostering a healthy safety culture among employees are essential for operational excellence.

Characteristics of a Healthy Work Culture:

A healthy work culture leads to satisfied employees and increased productivity.

    - Key attributes include mutual respect and cordiality, impartial treatment, recognition of good performance, encouragement of discussion and transparent communication, employee-friendly policies, mentorship-based rather than authoritarian leadership, and team-building activities.

Managerial Role in Safety:

    - Managers play a pivotal role in safety management by demonstrating commitment, promoting safety in daily activities, and leading by example. Key processes supporting safety promotion include training, effective safety communication, and toolbox meetings.

###### Five Guiding Safety Behaviours

The Safety I's. . .

- Insight: Seeking and sharing knowledge by asking questions and sharing experiences.

- Innovation: Continuously thinking of new and better ways of doing.

- Influence: Being a good role model, influence colleagues with your own good behaviours and accept influence from others.

- Intervention: Backing each other up by stopping and correcting unsafe acts.

- Integration: Prioritizing safety at all times and making it a part of everything you do.

. . .form the foundation of organizational and individual safety culture. They guide daily practices and interactions within any organization.

Toolbox Meeting

An informal discussion among the work group at the worksite to discuss task-related information, risks, and mitigating measures. Conducted not earlier than 15 minutes before task commencement, all team members should sign to signify understanding and compliance.

De-briefing

Crucial for enhancing planning and risk mitigation, de-briefing after critical tasks allows teams to review difficulties and risks faced during the job. Use findings to improve planning and safety in the future.

Unsafe Act and Unsafe Condition

Unsafe acts occur when safety barriers are breached. An unsafe act is any task done in a way that risks health or safety. Examples include unauthorized equipment use, not securing materials, operating too quickly, failing to issue warnings, using defective tools, removing guards, improper tool use, unsafe posture, servicing moving equipment, riding inappropriate equipment, horseplay, and not wearing PPE.

Common causes of unsafe acts include shortcuts to save time, overconfidence, starting tasks without full instructions, poor housekeeping, ignoring safety procedures, mental distractions, and failing to pre-plan work with risk assessments and toolbox talks.

An unsafe condition is a workplace situation likely to cause damage or injury. Examples include lack of guards, inadequate warning systems, fire hazards, poor housekeeping, unexpected movements, protruding objects, blocked passageways, poor storage, hazardous tools or materials, bad lighting, high noise levels, hazardous atmospheric conditions, and improper attire. Keeping work areas clean, ensuring proper storage, and taking precautions in poor lighting or noisy environments are essential to prevent accidents.

##### Stop Work Authority (SWA)

###### Eye and Face Protection Guidelines

Use visors when welding, gas-cutting, or grinding on abrasive wheels.

Wear goggles to protect eyes from foreign bodies and hazards.

- E.g. infra-red rays, ultra-violet rays, or small particles (chippings, scale, chemicals, or paint).

Safety spectacles offer comfort but less protection than goggles.

Use darkened-glass visors/goggles when exposure to ultra-violet or infra-red rays is possible.

Exercise judgment when conditions require temporary removal of safety glasses. Ensure proper selection of eye and face protection based on potential hazards. Guidance is provided in the following table.

Notes to Eye and Face Protection Selection:

- Consider the possibility of multiple and simultaneous hazards.

- Use face shields over primary eye protection.

- Select appropriate filter lenses and shades.

- Prescription lens wearers must use protective devices accommodated for them.

- Contact lens wearers need additional eye and face protection to protect from dust and chemicals.

- Exercise caution with metal frame protective devices in electrical hazard areas.

- Prevent fogging of lenses in restricted ventilation conditions with frequent cleaning.

- Ensure adequate ventilation and protection from splash entry.

- Use specialized eye protectors for specific tasks outside the accommodation.

- Do not use general safety glasses for tasks requiring specialized equipment (e.g. welding visors).

###### Head Protection Guidelines

Hard hats safeguard against impact, penetration, electric shock, and burns. Wear head protection in areas with falling object hazards such as:

- Working below machinery, or workers using tools or materials, that may cause objects to fall.

- Working around conveyor belts or machinery.

- Working on exposed energized conductors.

Use hard hats with chin straps outside accommodation spaces, wheelhouse, ECR, and CCR to ensure secure fit during work.

Safety helmets must be worn in specified locations including mooring decks, cargo decks, engine rooms, during emergency drills, and when required by the Master.

Retire helmets if they incur a blow, regardless of visible damage, and replace parts as per the specified maintenance schedule:

    - Outer shell: Replaced every 5 years.

    - Ratchet: Replaced at least every 12 months.

    - Any doubt about helmet condition warrants immediate replacement.

Note: Company standardized use of V-GUARD 930 helmets provided with specific maintenance instructions including service life, care, and replacement procedures.

###### Ear Protection Guidelines

Wear ear defenders in noisy spaces like engine rooms to prevent irreversible hearing damage.

Display signs at entrances to noisy areas such as engine rooms, steering gear flats, fan rooms, compressor rooms, P/R, emergency generator rooms, hydraulic power pack spaces, em. fire pump room, and other high noise areas to indicate the necessity of ear protection.

###### Foot Protection Guidelines

Wear safety boots or shoes properly fastened during working hours to protect against various hazards.

- Avoid wearing flip-flops or similar footwear while on duty, especially during bridge duty or when using staircases in the accommodation.

- Use safety footwear with ASTM Standard-compliant impact and compression protection, and consider metatarsal protection for specific work situations.

- Wear safety shoes or boots in designated areas including mooring decks, monkey island or flying bridge, cargo decks, machinery spaces, workshops, galleys, preparation rooms, tanks, void spaces, and during emergency drills as directed by the master.

- Utilize sea boots with safety steel toes and chemical-resistant properties in areas with excess water accumulation or oil spill clean-up operations.

- Choose sensible footwear when not working to prevent slips and trips.

Ensure proper care, storage, and replacement of footwear:

- Check production date before wearing (found on tongue of shoe).

- Do not use shoes older than 5 years; or those older than 3 years without passing the twist test.

- Store in a dry atmosphere at approximately 20°C to maintain product integrity.

- In hot and humid climates, prevent hydrolysis by limiting PU sole shoes' storage duration to 8 months.

- Regularly polish and waterproof leather footwear to maintain durability.

- Avoid excess stock onboard to prevent deterioration and ensure product safety.

###### Hand Protection Guidelines

Wear gloves whenever possible, except when operating rotating machine tools. Gloves prevent cuts, abrasions, burns, and skin contact with chemicals. Common glove materials provide limited protection against many chemicals, so select the appropriate glove for each application, determine its wear duration, and whether it can be reused. Request documentation from the supplier to ensure the gloves meet the relevant test standards for anticipated hazards.

When selecting gloves, consider cost-effectiveness. Regularly changing cheaper gloves may be cheaper than reusing more expensive types (so long as performance is acceptable). Evaluate the employee's work activity to determine the required dexterity, duration, frequency, exposure to hazards, and physical stress.

For chemical hazards, identify the toxic properties of the chemical, particularly its ability to cause skin effects or pass through the skin. Most "chemical resistant" gloves can be used for dry powders. For mixtures, select a glove based on the chemical component with the shortest breakthrough time. Ensure employees can remove gloves without skin contamination.

Do not wear finger rings when working, especially with machinery, wires, or ropes. Be cautious when wearing gloves while climbing ladders, working with mooring lines, or near moving machinery.

Use the correct industrial gloves for the task unless it increases the risk of injury. Follow these guidelines for glove selection:

- Leather/Cloth: Protects against rough or sharp edges, splinters, and very cold metals.

- Rubber: For working on electrical equipment.

- PVC: Protects against corrosives, solvents, and other chemicals.

- Heat Resistant: For handling hot objects, such as in the galley or metalwork.

- Long-Sleeved Clothing: Various materials offer protection against corrosives and are used when welding.

The Company supplies A725 working gloves. For maintenance, hand wash A725 gloves in warm soapy water using household laundry detergent (avoid harsh cleaning agents) and air dry to maintain long-term material performance.

###### Body Protection Guidelines

Wear protective clothing or overalls to mitigate foreseeable risks in relevant work areas.

Wear overalls in the following situations:

- In the Engine Room (E/R) or any space containing machinery.

- Outside accommodation or bridge.

- During storing operations.

- When using paint or blasting equipment.

- When using scaling, drilling, grinding, or cutting equipment.

- When handling acids or chemicals.

Ensure work clothing is close-fitting without loose flaps, scarves, or belts, and avoid bulging pockets.

Boiler suits should have full-length sleeves and legs, with the front fastened securely to the top of the chest and no loose pocket flaps.

Change and wash clothing frequently to prevent accumulation of oil and chemicals, which can lead to skin irritation and health issues, especially when handling food.

Personnel should be aware of the risks of dermatitis or skin cancer from prolonged contact with various mineral oils.

Note: In galley or E/R spaces, clothing must adequately cover the body to minimize the risk of burns or scalding.

High-visibility overalls/jackets should be worn when working on cargo and mooring decks, especially at night.

Wear protective overalls when dealing with hazardous spills and approved fire-fighting suits during serious fires.

During port operations, wear the company-supplied boiler suit.

Crewmembers must maintain an acceptable dress standard, preferably with clothes made of cotton or cotton mixture. Clothes should preferably be nonflammable

Caution: Protective clothing may contain synthetic materials. Do not put on or remove them in hazardous areas.

When boiler suits and safety boots are not required, officers should wear uniforms or equivalent clothing appropriate to the climate, while ratings should wear adequate clothing and footwear for their duties.

During off-duty periods, maintain clean, tidy attire suitable for the occasion and climate, avoiding flip-flops or footwear without suitable straps.

###### Safety Harness Guidelines

Use safety harnesses when working aloft, overside, or at heights above deck on the vessel.

Utilize safety harnesses with a shock absorber measuring 1.25m in length and lifeline when working:

- Up masts or funnels.

- On stages, chairs, or cradles.

- Over side.

- On rigging gangways or accommodation ladders.

- In lifeboats or on davits.

- Wear safety harnesses in any situation with a risk of falling more than 2 meters.

- Where suitable securing points are unavailable, arrange adequate points e.g. by using a gantline with loops spliced at 2-metre intervals.

Note:	This requirement specifically includes working from a cradle, stage or bosun's chair and includes working over side.

Caution: Ensure suitable securing points are available, and do not use body belts with lanyards for fall arrest systems due to the risk of injury or death.

###### Buoyancy Aids Guidance

Wear a buoyancy aid and safety harness when working overside or where there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of falling or being washed overboard from the ship or ship's boat.

- Keep a lifebuoy with attached light and a quoit and line ready for immediate use at the work site.

- Avoid working overside when the ship is underway.

###### Torches and Portable Lights:

Use only torches that have been approved for use in flammable atmospheres by a competent authority.

- Torches used with alkaline batteries must have the manufacturer's approval.

- Portable lights for use anywhere outside the E/R or accommodation must be similarly approved.

###### Breathing Equipment

Use respiratory protective equipment when working in conditions of irritating, dangerous, or poisonous dust, fumes, or gases.

The equipment may be either a respirator, which filters the air before it is breathed, or a breathing apparatus, which supplies air or oxygen from an uncontaminated source.

Consider the following when selecting respiratory protective equipment:

- Nature of the hazard.

- Severity of the hazard.

- Work requirements and conditions.

- Characteristics and limitations of available equipment.

Provide all users with advice on the use and maintenance of their respiratory protective equipment.

Breathing Apparatus (BA):

- Wear breathing apparatus when firefighting, in confined spaces, where a toxic/oxygen-deficient atmosphere is suspected, when combating hazardous cargo incidents, and when entering dangerous spaces, etc.

- Ensure all crew can wear the breathing apparatus, are trained to wear it correctly, and wear it when required during training or emergencies.

- Individuals must not have facial hair that may compromise the safety of the wearer.

Note: All wearers should be able to perform the leak test. Masters should contact the office in case of doubt.

Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBAs) are essential safety devices on ships, allowing independent movement with air drawn from an integral cylinder. Some models can be air-line fed for extended use, with a reserve air supply for emergencies.

Duration factors include the user’s fitness and training as well as effort level. A trained user consumes about 40 liters of air per minute; an inexperienced user may consume up to 80 liters.

Cylinder Specifications:

- Sizes: Typically 6 liter; or 4 liter cylinders.

- Pressure:

        - - 6 liters cylinders working pressure is 200 bars.

        - - 4 liters  cylinders working pressure is 300 bars.

        - - Maximum pressure is stamped on the cylinder.

- Air Quantity: Water capacity (liters) x pressure (bars). For example, a 6-liter cylinder at 200 bars holds about 1200 liters of air.

Usage Duration:

- A 6-liter cylinder at 200 bars lasts about 30 minutes; working duration is approximately 20 minutes, allowing a 10-minute safety reserve.

- 4-liter cylinders at 300 bars last about 30 minutes; working duration is approximately 20 minutes, allowing a 10-minute safety reserve.

- Practice under varying conditions to assess personal endurance.

SOLAS Requirements: Ships must have a portable air compressor for recharging SCBA cylinders, with air quality certified annually. If no compressor is available, an adequate number of spare cylinders must be onboard, considering:

- Flag administration requirements

- Trading patterns

- Voyage duration

- Availability and cost of refilling cylinders at ports

- Frequency of fire and enclosed space entry drills.

Emergency Escape Breathing Devices (EEBDs):

Each ship is equipped with EEBDs of 10 or 15 minutes duration, located in various designated places, including the engine control room; E/R workshop; E/R bottom platform (along escape route); E/R platform; and cargo control room.

    - Additionally, spare units are available for tank entry but must not be deployed on-site.

    - Fire control plans should indicate location of EEBDs

    - Stow charging adaptor for connecting EEBDs to charging compressor in a clearly identified location.

    - Maintain EEBDs as per the manufacturer’s instructions and ensure they are fully charged at all times.

Use EEBDs to escape from a compartment with a hazardous atmosphere.

Inspect EEBDs monthly and train personnel in their use during fire drills, integrating training into fire drills at intervals not exceeding 3 months.

Caution: Do not use EEBDs for fires, oxygen-deficient voids, or tanks. Use a compressed air breathing apparatus (CABA) for such situations.

Respirators / Face Masks:

Respirators do not provide protection against oxygen-deficient atmospheres or against hazards caused by toxic gases.

Do not use respirators:

- When expecting the presence of chemicals identified as toxic by the Codes.

- Instead of breathing apparatus.

- To provide protection in confined spaces such as cofferdams, double bottoms, or other similar spaces against dangerous fumes, gases, or vapors.

TANKERS ONLY

Use breathing apparatus during cargo operations involving toxic cargoes or in atmospheres with a risk of oxygen deficiency, exposure to poisonous, dangerous, or irritating fumes, or gases.

DRY CARGO VESSELS ONLY

Grain cargoes may be subject to fumigation. IMO recommends that the ship’s personnel defer handling fumigants to qualified operators.

Fumigants with phosphine generatig gases are toxic and inhalation may cause respiratory issues, nausea, or suffocation.

Monitor gas concentrations in living or working spaces regularly.

On a daily basis during fumigation in transit, before commencing routine working day, measure phosphine concentration levels in all deck areas, deck store, lockers, void and cofferdams, and forecastle. Wear a gas filter respirator.

Caution: Do not enter compartments adjacent to fumigated cargo holds without proper ventilation. Wear Gas Filter Respirators during fumigation and ventilation processes.

###### Aprons

Chemical Aprons

- Used for handling concentrated chemical products and cleaning empty chemical containers before disposal.

- Materials: PVC, nitrile rubber, neoprene, or disposable polyethylene.

###### High-Visibility Safety Apparel (HVSA)

Purpose: Improves visibility in low light and dark conditions.

Usage: Alerts vehicle operators during cargo operations involving cranes or container cargo.

###### Personal Multi-gas Detector

Purpose: Used for evaluating the atmosphere, specifically for toxic gases, before entry into enclosed spaces.

Calibration: Multi-gas detectors have several sensors for various gases, requiring calibration, which can be time-consuming. Using a multi-component calibration gas mixture can reduce calibration time and effort.

Mandatory Use: Before and during entry into enclosed spaces, particularly on chemical tankers carrying toxic or corrosive cargoes, and during bunkering.

###### Hand-Held Bellows Pump

Description: Hollow glass tubes are inserted into a hand-held bellows pump, drawing a metered volume of the sample for testing.

Procedure: Tubes are coated internally with a reagent, sealed at both ends, and broken just before use. As the sample is drawn through the tube, toxic gas discolours the reagent, indicating the gas content in parts per million (ppm) by volume.

###### Resuscitation Equipment

Types: Range from simple, hand-operated bellows to automatic equipment providing continuous resuscitation for extended periods.

Media: Uses either oxygen or air for resuscitation, with caution regarding the use of oxygen in potentially flammable atmospheres.

This procedure provides guidance on maintaining safety for walkways, catwalks, ladders, mooring stations, and open deck areas to prevent slips and falls, ensuring they remain in suitable condition and safe during work.

###### Responsibilities

Ship staff, under the supervision of the heads of department and master, must maintain and provide safe walkways on board according to industrial requirements and safe working practices.

###### Slip Hazards

- Slip hazards may arise from:

- Wet floors/decks

- Oily/greasy floors/decks

- Highly waxed and polished floors

- Ice on deck

###### Precautions

Ensure shoe soles provide good traction. Flip-flops should be restricted to cabin use and avoided during bridge duty or on staircases.

Clean any spilled liquid from the deck immediately.

Be alert for tripping hazards such as hoses, lines, shallow holds, extension cords, loose shoelaces, etc. Action should be taken to eliminate these hazards where possible.

Use anti-skid paint to coat decks, especially in mooring areas and emergency embarkation decks. Maintenance or overcoating safety walking areas must be done properly using anti-skid paint.

Treat areas made slippery by snow or ice with sand or other suitable materials and enforce cold weather precautions.

Protect deck or walkway openings with barricades, railings, or ropes to prevent falls. Mark obstructions and caution areas with yellow and black diagonal zebra stripes to highlight hazards.

When working in elevated locations:

- Clean up oil spills immediately.

- Take special precautions in locations without handrails.

- Rig temporary barriers to prevent falls where safety lines cannot be used.

- Use safety harnesses.

- Keep walkways and work areas clear of obstructions.

- Use barricades to prevent entry into unsafe areas.

- Avoid running on deck as much as possible.

## 5.2 Risk and Incident Management



### 5.2.1 Risk Management - rev 0 issued 06.11.2024

##### Risk Management and Assessment Procedure

###### Introduction

The optimal approach to avoid incidents is to have a robust risk management process focused on identifying, analyzing, and mitigating risks. The main steps include:

- Identification of hazards

- Assessment of risks associated with those hazards

- Application of controls to reduce intolerable risks

- Monitoring the effectiveness of controls

Definitions:

- Risk (IMO): Combination of the frequency (likelihood) and severity of the consequence (MSC-MEPC.2/Circ.12/Rev.2).

- Risk Assessment: Overall process of risk identification, risk analysis, and risk evaluation (ISO 31000:2018 definition 2.16 and ISO Guide 73:2009, definition 3.4.1).

Associated Risks:

- Health and safety of personnel

- Property of the company and others

- The environment

Hazard: Potential to cause harm (e.g., death, injury, illness, environmental/property damage). Everyone is responsible for identifying hazards.

Risk Assessment evaluates:

- What could cause harm (hazard)?

- What could go wrong (risk)?

- Likelihood of occurrence?

- Severity of consequences?

Risk Rating: Determined using a likelihood and consequence matrix. Refer to HSEQ 06 – Risk Assessment Worksheet and Matrix Rev.5.

Risk Control: Process of modifying risk by selecting and implementing control options. Refer to HSEQ 06 – Risk Assessment Worksheet and Matrix Rev.5, Hierarchy of Controls tab.

###### Responsibilities

Master: Reviews risk assessments and control measures to mitigate risks.

Heads of Department and Assigned Supervisor:

- Conduct thorough risk assessments using the hazard wheel tool under the “identifying hazards” section.

- Implement appropriate control measures before work begins.

- Maintain records.

Office Risk Assessment Verification Team:

- Consists of Technical, Marine, and Quality/Safety Superintendents.

- Verifies and approves (when required) risk assessments submitted by vessels.

###### The Risk Management Process

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating the risks associated with the safety of crew, cargo, and environmental protection.

The risk assessment process may be summarized by the flowchart below.

###### Step 1 – Preparation

The initial stage of the risk management process occurs before the job and involves the following key actions:

- Familiarization with the Work Process: Define the job scope, check job procedures, and descriptions.

- Create a Risk Assessment: Identify hazards, evaluate associated risks, and determine effective control measures to eliminate or reduce each risk.

- Prepare Tools/Equipment and PPE: Ensure the right tools, equipment, and appropriate personal protective equipment are ready.

####### Familiarization with the Job Process

Understand the sequence and flow of work to complete the job successfully. General guidance includes:

- Job Initiation: Understand job requirements and restrictions, review manuals, drawings, job instructions, and consult with Heads of Department (HoD) and supervisors.

- Planning and Preparation: Create a work plan and schedule, identify required resources (materials, equipment, personnel), and consider safety, hazards, and regulatory requirements.

- Task Execution: Carry out defined tasks and activities, use tools/equipment, follow procedures and checklists, and make decisions based on job requirements.

- Monitoring and Quality Control: Implement monitoring and control measures to ensure work accuracy and adherence to industry standards and IMS procedures. Perform regular checks, inspections, and tests.

- Collaboration and Communication: Coordinate with crewmembers, supervisors, and third-party contractors as needed. Share information, seek clarification, provide updates, and ensure smooth and safe job execution.

- Troubleshooting and Problem-solving: Address challenges or unexpected issues, analyze problems and safety hazards, seek assistance or guidance, and implement solutions.

- Completion and Review: Assess job results, compare them against desired objectives, make adjustments or improvements, and document lessons learned for future reference or process improvement.

####### Create Risk Assessment

Use the following approach to identify and categorize hazards on board vessels:

- Conduct a Workplace Walkthrough: Physically inspect the workplace, observe work processes, equipment, and environmental conditions. Note any unsafe situations or practices.

- Identify Potential Hazards: Based on observations, identify specific hazards, such as:

- Physical Hazards: Slippery floors, machinery without proper guarding, inadequate lighting, noise, weather conditions, extreme temperatures.

- Chemical Hazards: Exposure to hazardous chemicals, improper storage or handling of chemicals, lack of proper ventilation.

- Biological Hazards: Presence of bacteria, viruses, fungi, exposure to blood or body fluids, contact with disease-carrying insects.

- Ergonomic Hazards: Repetitive tasks, awkward postures, heavy lifting, lack of ergonomic equipment.

- Psychosocial Hazards: High work demands, long hours, job insecurity, lack of support, workplace violence, bullying, stress.

Categorize the Hazards: Use the Hazard Identification Wheel tool to categorize hazards. Refer to HSEQ 06 – Risk Assessment Worksheet and Matrix Rev. 5, Hazard Identification Wheel tab for detailed categories and hazards list.

The hazard wheel consists of two circles for situational and energy hazards.

  - Hazard Identification Wheel

Often, situational hazards seem less obvious than energy hazards. However, both hazards are equally important to be identified before you perform a job. Remember to involve crewmembers in the hazard identification process.

Caution: Hazard is different from risk.

A hazard is something that can cause harm: e.g., electricity, chemicals, noise.

A risk is the likelihood of that hazard to cause harm and the severity of the consequences of that harm.

1. Evaluating the Risks Associated with the Identified Hazards

This is a critical step in ensuring the safety of crew on board vessels. Use the form "HSEQ 06 – Risk Assessment Worksheet and Matrix Rev. 5" to document the risk assessment process.

Key Steps to Evaluate Risks:

- Likelihood of Occurrence: Assess the likelihood of each identified hazard causing harm or an incident. Consider Frequency and duration of exposure as well as possibility of an event occurring. Historical data or incident records can give insights into likelihood

- Potential Consequences: Evaluate the potential consequences or severity of harm that could result from each hazard. Consider possible fatalities, injuries, illnesses, property damage, environmental impact, operational disruptions, and media attention.

- Risk Matrix: Use the risk matrix to categorize risks based on their likelihood and consequences. This helps prioritize risks and determine the appropriate level of control measures needed.

- Risk Ranking: Assign a risk ranking to each identified hazard based on the evaluation of likelihood and consequences. This ranking is numerical and color-coded, indicating higher levels of risk.

- Risk Assessment Documentation: Document the results of the risk evaluation for each identified hazard, clearly stating the likelihood, consequences, and risk ranking.

2. Identifying Control Measures to Eliminate or Reduce the Risks

Once risks have been assessed, they need to be controlled to either eliminate or reduce them to an acceptable level. The hierarchy of controls in the HSEQ 06 – Risk Assessment Worksheet and Matrix Rev. 5 provides a structured approach with types of risk controls.

Engineering Controls:

- Install safety guards, barriers, or shields.

- Implement ventilation systems.

3. Re-assessment of RAs after Implementation of Control Measures

Once risk controls are applied, re-assess the risk to see if the risk rating has changed. Effective risk controls often reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring.

4. Approval and Communication of Risk Assessment

Final approval of a risk assessment confirms proper assessment and implementation of control measures.

Process for Approval:

- Risk Assessment Completion: Ensure the risk assessment is completed, including hazard identification, risk evaluation, and documentation of control measures.

- Review by Responsible Persons:

- Submit the completed risk assessment for review by the Master for SLIGHT or MINOR risks.

- Submit for review and approval by the office “Risk Assessment Verification Team” for MODERATE, HIGH, or EXTREME risks.

### 5.2.4 Vessel Health Risk Assessment - rev 0 issued 06.11.2024

##### Vessel Health Risk Assessment

Purpose: These procedures aim to monitor and improve the quality of the working environment on board.

###### Responsibilities

Superintendents and Port Captains: Conduct vessel health risk assessments during their visits on board.

Master: Inform all shipboard personnel about these instructions and ensure they become familiar with them.

Heads of Departments:

- Implement these instructions.

- Organize work on board.

- Monitor the safety and health of crewmembers.

- Implement procedures and preventive measures to reduce the risk of accidents or health hazards.

###### Vessel Health Risk Assessment Guidance

Procedures and preventive measures related to the management of noise, vibrations, and working in hot environments are described in IMS – 10. Continuous Improvement - 10.4 Internal Audits – Vessel Health Risk Assessment.

###### Exposure to Noise Levels Guidance

Noise on board ships can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. Temporary deafness after leaving a noisy place, although normally recovering within a few hours, should not be ignored as it indicates potential for permanent damage. Permanent hearing damage can occur immediately from extremely loud explosive noises or gradually from prolonged exposure, such as working in an engine room without hearing protection.

Risk Assessment for Noise Exposure:

If the initial risk assessment identifies areas or activities with potential harmful noise levels, noise measurements may be required. Use the following rough guide to determine if noise measurements are necessary:

Guidelines for Noise Measurement:

- Shouting Test: If seafarers need to shout to be heard clearly by someone 2 meters away.

- Temporary Hearing Loss: If seafarers experience temporary dullness of hearing or ringing in their ears after leaving the work area.

- Impulsive Noises: If seafarers are exposed to sudden, loud noises such as the release of compressed air or cartridge-operated tools.

- High-Level Impact Noise: If seafarers are exposed to high-level impact noise from activities like hammering on metal surfaces or using chipping hammers.

- Machinery Spaces: If seafarers work in machinery spaces.

These guidelines help determine the need for further noise assessments to ensure the working environment is safe and health risks are minimized.

As a rough guide to determine whether noise measurements are required the test below can be used:

If any of these tests fail, then a series of measurements will be necessary to assess the seafarer’s noise exposure to determine if the exposure action value or exposure limit values have been exceeded.

The noise measurements can be performed by the auditor using sound-measuring equipment (there are several applications available).

The exposure action values and exposure limit values are:

Where:

“A-weighted‟ is used to measure average noise levels;

“C-weighted‟ is used to measure peak, impact or explosive noises;

Except in an emergency, noise in the accommodation and service spaces should not exceed the following limits:

##### Exposure to Vibrations Guidance

Ongoing review of vibration issues on board ships aims to improve protection for seafarers from adverse effects. Vibrations from machinery should be measured yearly by an external contractor, arranged by the technical department. Reports should be reviewed, and if excessive vibrations are found, maintenance or alternative measures (e.g., installing vibration dampers) should be implemented to restore acceptable levels.

The company must ensure that workers exposed to significant vibration are:

- Informed about the hazards and risks of prolonged use of vibrating tools.

- Informed on measures within their control to minimize risk, particularly proper adjustment of seating and working positions.

- Instructed in the correct handling and use of hand tools with a light but safe grip.

- Encouraged to report finger blanching, numbness, or tingling without facing unwarranted discrimination, with recourse available under national law and practice.

Conduct a physical inspection of the vessel to assess other factors, recording findings in form HSEQ 05 – Internal Audit Questionnaire. Document conclusions and suggestions in form HESQ 27 - Safety Audit Report form. Maintain a copy of the vessel health risk assessment on board as part of the Internal Audit documentation.

###### Exposure to Heat Guidance

Jobs involving operations in hot environments can cause heat stress in employees. These operations include those involving radiant heat sources, high humidity, direct contact with hot objects, or strenuous activities. The effects of heat stress can range from mild annoyances, such as heat rash, to death from heat stroke.

Specific signs and symptoms of heat stress include:

- Heat rash

- Heat cramps

- Heat exhaustion

- Heat stroke

To mitigate these risks, ensure that:

- Proper hydration and rest breaks are provided.

- Work schedules are adjusted to cooler times of the day if possible.

- Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is used.

- Workers are trained to recognize symptoms of heat stress and respond appropriately.

Preventing Adverse Effects: Ensure proper fluid replacement and adherence to work/rest regimens.

Causes of Heat Stress in Hot Environments An employee can be affected by heat stress due to:

- Heat combined with physical labor

- Loss of fluids

- Fatigue

Assessment and Strategy: Each job should be assessed for these factors to develop a preventive strategy.

Training and Environmental Controls: Train employees to recognize heat stress. Implement environmental controls to isolate or eliminate heat sources, such as:

- Air conditioning

- Increased general ventilation

- Cooling fans

- Local exhaust ventilation at points of high heat production or moisture (e.g., exhaust hoods in laundry rooms)

- Reflective shields to redirect radiant heat

- Insulation of hot surfaces (e.g., furnace walls)

- Elimination of steam leaks

Acclimatization and Scheduling: Allow time for employees to acclimatize to hot environments. Schedule tasks during cooler parts of the day and provide alternate tasks when possible.

Proper Clothing and Hydration:

- Ensure proper clothing is worn to prevent heat stress.

- Encourage workers to drink adequate replacement fluids even if not thirsty. A person should drink 5.5 liters of water per day in frequent, small rations.

- Monitor fluid loss: if a 90 kg employee loses more than 1.4 kg in a day, they need to drink more fluids.

- Avoid distributing liquids with caffeine, alcohol, or large amounts of sugar. Avoid very cold drinks.

Breaks and Cooling: Take breaks in shaded or air-conditioned locations as appropriate. Provide cool fluids during breaks. If someone develops symptoms of heat exhaustion or heat stroke, move them to a cool area, provide fluids, and evaluate them medically.

Buddy System and Fitness: Use the buddy system to monitor co-workers for heat stress. Encourage employees to maintain physical fitness.

Heat Index

The Heat Index measures how hot it feels when humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature. It helps in assessing the severity of heat and planning preventive measures accordingly.

Protective measures for worksites taking into consideration the Heat Index are given above. Several methods must be applied depending on the severity of discomfort as categorized in the following table:

####### Actions for Lower (Caution) Risk Conditions: Heat Index is < 91°F

When the heat index is below 91°F (33°C), most people can work safely with basic measures in place. Employers must:

- Provide adequate drinking water in convenient, visible locations close to the work area.

- Ensure adequate medical services are available.

- Take additional precautions based on site conditions, workload, and protective clothing used.

- Follow actions described for Moderate Risk Conditions (91°F (33°C) - 103°F (39°C)) if heat index is close to 91°F (33°C), or if work is conducted in direct sunlight or without a light breeze.

- Implement extra precautions for workers wearing heavy or non-breathable clothing or impermeable chemical protective clothing, as they are at greater risk even at lower temperatures. Monitor these workers closely for signs of heat-related illness and refer to the High Risk Conditions precautions.

- Acclimatize new and returning workers performing strenuous work, as they may be at high risk for heat-related illness, even with a low heat index.

- Regularly check weather forecasts during warm seasons to prepare for more extreme hot weather conditions.

- Train workers to recognize symptoms of heat-related illness, understand individual risk factors, and know how to prevent and respond to symptoms.

- Encourage workers to wear sunscreen and use other protections from direct sunlight. Provide shade, hats, and sunscreen when possible. Sunburn reduces the skin's ability to release excess heat, increasing susceptibility to heat-related illness.

####### Actions for Moderate Risk Conditions: 91°F (33°C) to 103°F (39°C)

At moderate risk levels, additional precautions are needed to prevent heat-related illness:

- Review heat-related illness signs and precautions with workers.

- Remind workers to drink water regularly.

- Provide opportunities for workers to rest in cool, shaded areas.

- Alert workers to the anticipated heat index and identify site-specific precautions to reduce risk.

- Provide adequate amounts of cool water in convenient, visible locations close to the work area.

- Encourage workers to drink small amounts of water frequently, ideally about 1 liter per hour.

- Ensure adequate medical services are available.

- Treat workers showing symptoms of heat-related illness immediately. Early treatment of milder symptoms (headache, weakness) with rest and cool water can prevent serious emergencies.

- Use Medical Radio Advice immediately if a worker loses consciousness or appears confused or uncoordinated, as these are signs of possible heat stroke.

- Review signs and symptoms of heat-related illness and site-specific precautions during daily meetings or toolbox talks. Ensure everyone knows procedures for responding to possible heat-related illness, including steps to follow if symptoms appear, who to call for medical help, and who will provide first aid until evacuation is possible.

- Schedule frequent rest breaks in cool, shaded areas.

- Provide air-conditioned or shaded areas close to the work area.

- Set up temporary shade if there is no easy access to shade or air conditioning.

- Acclimatize new and returning workers gradually by increasing workloads or allowing more frequent breaks. Allow all workers more frequent breaks if the heat index increases suddenly.

- Implement actions for High-Risk Conditions (103°F (39°C) - 115°F (46°C)) if the heat index approaches 103°F or work is strenuous, in direct sunlight, or involves heavy or non-breathable clothing or impermeable chemical protective clothing.

- Set up a buddy system to enable workers to monitor each other for signs of heat-related illness.

- Instruct supervisors to watch for signs of heat-related illness and routinely check that workers are drinking enough water, using shade, and not experiencing heat-related symptoms.

- Encourage workers to wear sunscreen and use protections from direct sunlight. Provide shade, hats, and sunscreen when possible. Sunburn reduces the skin's ability to release excess heat and can lead to skin cancer.

####### Actions for High-Risk Conditions: 103°F (39°C) to 115°F (46°C)

When the heat index exceeds 103°F (39°C), there is a high risk for heat-related illness, requiring additional protective measures:

- Rest Periods: Increase rest periods and assign a knowledgeable person to determine appropriate work/rest schedules.

- Workload Reduction: Reduce the workload and pace of strenuous tasks.

- Hydration: Remind workers to drink water every 15 to 20 minutes.

- Daily Alerts: Inform workers of the day's heat index and identify precautions in place.

- Training: Review signs and symptoms of heat-related illness during daily meetings. Ensure everyone knows the response procedures:

- Steps to follow if a worker exhibits symptoms

- Who to call for medical help

- How to give clear directions to the worksite

- Who will provide first aid until help arrives

- Water Availability: Provide plenty of cool water in convenient, visible locations close to the work area. Encourage workers to drink about 1 liter per hour.

- Immediate Response: Ensure medical services are available and respond to heat-related illnesses without delay. Use Medical Radio Advice if a worker loses consciousness or appears confused.

- Knowledgeable Person Onsite: Have someone well-informed about heat-related illnesses onsite to modify work activities and schedules as needed.

- Work/Rest Schedules: Establish and enforce work/rest schedules. Provide cool, shaded areas for breaks and recovery periods.

- Adjust Work Activities:

- Schedule heavy tasks for cooler parts of the day.

- Set up shade canopies or move jobs to shaded areas.

- Assign strenuous tasks only to acclimatized workers and rotate tasks among them.

- Decrease physical demands and pace of work.

- Add extra personnel to physically demanding tasks to reduce intensity.

- Acclimatization: Gradually increase workloads and allow more breaks during the first week. Closely supervise new employees for the first 14 days.

- Extra Precautions: If the heat index approaches 115°F (46°C) or work is in direct sunlight, take actions for Very High to Extreme Risk Conditions. Reschedule activities and adjust work/rest schedules. Monitor workers physiologically for signs of overexposure.

- Buddy System: Implement a buddy system for workers to monitor each other for symptoms of heat-related illness.

- Supervisor Monitoring: Instruct supervisors to watch for signs of heat-related illness and ensure workers use water and shade.

- Effective Communication: Maintain effective communication with the crew at all times. Confirm communication methods are working.

- Sunscreen and Sun Protection: Encourage the use of sunscreen and other protections from direct sunlight. Sunburn increases the risk of heat-related illness and can lead to skin cancer.

By following these guidelines, the risk of heat-related illnesses can be significantly reduced, ensuring a safer working environment during high heat conditions.

####### Actions for Very High to Extreme Risk Conditions: > 115°F (46°C)

In extremely hot and humid conditions, workers face a significantly higher risk of heat-related illness, which can develop quickly and be severe. Even acclimatized workers are at risk. Extra measures are necessary to protect workers under these conditions.

Rescheduling and Planning: Reschedule non-essential work: Move tasks to cooler times of the day or different days with a lower heat index.

Essential work: If work cannot be rescheduled, establish a water drinking schedule, enforce work/rest schedules, and monitor workers closely. A knowledgeable person must assess heat-related safety concerns.

Stop work: If essential control methods are inadequate, stop work when the heat index exceeds 115°F (46°C).

Precautions for Emergency and Essential Work:

Daily Alerts: Inform workers of the day’s heat index and precautions in place.

Training: Review heat-related illness signs and symptoms daily. Ensure everyone knows the response procedures:

- Steps to follow if a worker shows symptoms

- Who to call for medical help

- How to give clear directions to the worksite

- Who provides first aid until help arrives

Water: Provide plenty of cool drinking water near the work area and establish a drinking schedule. Workers should drink about 1 liter per hour during the hottest periods.

Medical Services: Ensure adequate medical services are available and respond to heat-related illnesses without delay.

Immediate Attention: Treat mild symptoms early with rest and cool water. Use Medical Radio Advice if a worker loses consciousness or appears confused. Heat stroke is fatal if not treated immediately.

Knowledgeable Person Onsite: Have someone well-informed about heat-related illness onsite to determine appropriate work/rest schedules and conduct physiological monitoring.

Work/Rest Schedules: Establish and enforce schedules, considering the level of physical exertion and type of protective equipment used. Provide shaded or air-conditioned areas for breaks.

Adjusting Work Activities:

- Shade Canopies: Set up over work areas in direct sunshine or move jobs to shaded areas.

- Strenuous Tasks: Only allow acclimatized workers to perform strenuous tasks. Rotate job tasks among workers.

- Physical Demands: Decrease job demands and pace. Change work/rest cycles to increase rest time.

- Additional Personnel: Add extra personnel for physically demanding tasks, especially those requiring heavy or non-breathable clothing.

- Job Rotation: Rotate workers to less strenuous or cooler tasks for part of the shift.

Acclimatization and Monitoring:

- Acclimatize Workers: Gradually increase workloads and allow frequent breaks during the first week. Closely supervise new employees for the first 14 days.

- Physiological Monitoring: Regularly check workers' heart rates, temperatures, or other signs of overexposure. Adjust work/rest periods based on monitoring results.

- Personal Cooling: Provide personal cooling measures.

- Buddy System: Implement a buddy system to monitor each other for signs of heat-related illness. Often, workers do not recognize their symptoms.

- Supervisor Monitoring: Instruct supervisors to watch for signs of heat-related illness. Check several times per hour to ensure workers use water and shade.

- Effective Communication: Maintain effective communication with the crew at all times.

Sun Protection: Sunscreen and Shade: Encourage the use of sunscreen and other protections from direct sunlight. Repeated sun exposure leads to skin cancer.

Health Risk Assessments: During assessments, auditors must verify environmental conditions and identify procedures to prevent excessive heat exposure.

By following these detailed precautions, the risk of heat-related illnesses can be minimized, ensuring a safer working environment during extreme heat conditions.

### 5.3.11 Personnel Transfer - rev 0 issued 06.11.2024

##### Personnel Transfer

###### Introduction

There are typically only four means of transferring personnel to and from commercial ships at sea:

- Helicopter landing

- Helicopter winching

- Support vessel using pilot ladder or a combination of pilot ladder and gangway

- Support vessel using ship’s crane and a Personal Transfer Basket

The Ship-to-Ship transfer industry has recognized that depending upon the conditions, the transfer by other means can introduce more risks than transfer by basket.

Transfer of personnel using the personnel basket and shipboard crane are high risk operations in view of the possible consequences to human life.  Those participating in the operation must consider the potential risks involved and mitigate those risks for every transfer.

In areas where personnel transfers via ship’s crane and personnel basket are common, personnel must ensure they do not become complacent and develop the attitude that this is commonplace, and therefore low risk evolution.

###### Responsibilities

The chief officer shall:

- Inspect the work area and equipment before start of personnel transfer.

- Carry out a risk assessment & take mitigating measures

- Prepare a personnel transfer by crane plan (form TANK 22).

- Complete form HSEQ 25 Personnel Transfer Permit.

Master shall approve the personnel transfer permit.

The masters of the vessel and workboat shall:

- Decide upon the necessity for a transfer

- Inspect and test the basket or work boat

- Brief the participants to ensure that the procedures are understood

- Notify the OOW prior to start of the operation

- Establish satisfactory relevant communications (both radio and visual) between the supervising officer, the workboat's master, the OOW and the crane driver

The master of the workboat shall confirm to the master of the vessel the following:

- He understands the procedure and accepts the transfer

- The vessel has satisfactory station keeping capability

- The deck crew is fully briefed

- The persons to be transferred are adequately briefed and fit to be transferred

- The workboat’s movement in the seaway is NOT outside safe parameters

- Where applicable the workboat is suitable for the transfer, the boat crew is competent and the boat is mechanically sound

Crane operator: The crane driver shall ensure that:

- Is familiar with the contents of the Risk assessment

- The permit to work is in place

- The crane is fully operational

- The wind speed is satisfactory for safe operation

- Has a full understanding of the requirements and procedures

- Has a full view of the pick-up and set down areas and/or the signalman

- Adequate communications have been established with the signalman, duty officer and the bridge

- The workboats movement is within safe tolerances

- The crane is fitted with a dead man’s handle

- The lift shall be carried out over the sea, wherever practicable

- The basket is not collapsed when landing it on deck

Using the Personnel Basket and Ship’s Crane Guidelines

Consider the guidance contained in sections 9.4, 9.4.1 and 9.4.2 of the ICS/OCIMF STS Transfer Guide when transferring personnel using the personnel basket and ship’s crane.

Note:	A vessel without equipment specifically designed and dedicated for purpose of personnel transfer will normally not meet all of the principles set out in section 9.4.2; however sometimes using the equipment poses a lower risk than other forms of transfer available.

Prepare risk assessment when considering personnel transfer via the personnel basket and ship’s crane to assess potential issues associated with the planned transfer and to plan for risk mitigation, if necessary.

A competent person shall inspect the crane prior to the lightering operation and report on the following:

- Planned maintenance is up-to-date

- Condition of wires and end fittings satisfactory

- Limit switches tested

- Fall arrest tested – if fitted

- Crane overload protection switches for cargo runner are operational

- Hook safety latch in good condition and operational

- Hoisting speed of cargo runner is adequate for expected movement of the vessels involved and expected freeboards

Record this pre-personnel transfer crane inspection in deck logbook.

The crane operator MUST have experience with:

- The particular crane onboard the vessel

- Personnel transfer using shipboard cranes

Prior to completing the permit for personnel transfer via shipboard crane and personnel basket, complete a  risk assessment analysis which shows that alternate methods of personnel transfer and their attendant risks were considered, the personnel transfer is necessary, and  personnel transfer via personnel basket is preferable given the hazard analysis and risk mitigation through the checklists.

Personnel transfer work permit ensures that hazard analysis and risk reductions takes place and are not to be regarded as irrelevant or time consuming – they are meant to be lifesaving.

Discuss the checklists amongst involved parties during the “checkoff” process, so that the information contained within them is exchanged and not simply stated as “checklist completed” over the radio.

###### Weather Criteria

Keep an eye on the changing weather.

In setting weather limits, consider probable effect on the equipment and personnel involved in the transfer of the following:

- Wave height and period

- Current - Speed with which anything in the water (i.e. a person or vessel without power) can be carried away.

- Wind speed:

- Effect of wind speed on aspect of personnel basket

- Ability to accurately throw lines or lifebuoys

- Visibility - Limited ability to see:

- Accidents

- Potential risks

- Rain (particularly over any oil on deck) can make decks and hand holds very slippery.

Below are guidelines for weather limits for transfers by basket:

Consider the following:

- Vessel

- The ability to hold station and heading.

- Rolling, pitching and the increase in vertical motion.

- Effects on footing when trying to get on or off a personnel basket

Note:	Sudden changes when landing on a rolling and pitching deck may make it difficult to maintain one’s balance.

- The fact that small craft may be upset.

- Cranes

- Hook control

- Boom motion

- Crane operator

- Competency

- Experience

###### During Darkness

Transfer operations shall normally be restricted to daylight hours only.

If a transfer during the hours of darkness is unavoidable, ensure that:

The transfer areas are adequately illuminated

The operation is conducted under the personal direction of the master

###### Equipment

Cranes should be electro-hydraulic only and ideally be fitted with a single wire runner suitable for snatch lifts. The hoisting speed should meet the following wave height criteria:

Wire runners should preferably be multi strand wire rope to avoid twisting.

Crane hooks used should be fitted with a:

- Short wire pennant, about 2 mtr long, inclusive of a safety hook. (to distance the basket from a larger hook)

- Safety device preventing the lifting ring from jumping off the hook

The hooks and section of wire rope 3 meters above the basket securing strap should be marked in high visibility orange using paint and parceling.

The SWL of the crane must be marked if used for personnel transfer - the SWL is decreased to meet a safety factor of “2” i.e. a crane nominally rated at 10 Tonnes SWL will be rated at 5 Tonnes SWL for use with personnel transfer.

###### Personal Transfer Basket

Personal transfer basket should be:

- Supplied by approved manufacturer

- Provided with certificate by the manufacturer

- Marked with makers’ nameplate data including:

- Fabrication date

- SWL

- Last test date

- Examined / inspected on board as per manufacturer’s instructions and PMS Job Card

- Condition of netting and whether sunlight degradation is suspected (powdering within strands).

- Securing points - check for deformations, condition of attachment to basket,

Note:	Keep proper record in Ship’s Crane Manual.

- Renewed every 3 years

Individuals who are to be transferred should:

- Ensure that they understand the transfer procedure

- Confirm that they agree with the transfer

- Be able to correctly use the safety equipment provided

- Observe instructions received from those in charge of the operation

- Wear buoyancy aid (floatation vests)

###### Basket Transfer Guidance

- Personnel use the basket in even numbers per transfer so as to maintain equal weight distribution

- Personnel stand on the OUTSIDE only - personal baggage only is placed inside the basket

- Personnel should wait until the basket has started to stretch to its normal lifting shape before climbing on - this will prevent them holding onto netting too high above the bottom ring

- As soon as the basket has settled onto the setting down point, personnel should step back off the bottom ring

Note:	Checking first to make sure the deck is clear of obstruction

- Once clear of the basket and on the deck, then remove personal baggage from inside the basket (the crane operator will prevent the basket from "collapsing").

- Only secure personal baggage within the basket

Caution:	Do not lift spare gear equipment using the basket.

- When picking up the basket, ensure the wire runner is in a direct vertical line so as to prevent any swing developing

- Ensure a small length of heaving line is attached to the bottom ring of the basket, so as to provide crew on deck an early purchase during lowering

- Designate a landing area (does not have to be painted area on deck but must be clear and defined). Personnel are aware of the intended landing area - the radius between this point and the ships' rail must be kept clear at all times.

- Ensure the landing area on deck is clean and free or substances, objects which might cause those handling taglines to slip or trip.

- When not in use, keep the baskets covered or suitably protected from sunlight.

- Do not use "Freefall" or non-powered lowering when personnel are carried in baskets

##### Training requirements

### 5.3.12 Simultaneous Operations - rev 0 issued 06.11.2024

##### Simultaneous Operations (SIMOPS)

###### Introduction

Simultaneous Operations (SIMOPS) occur when two or more potentially conflicting activities are executed in the same location at the same time, typically involving two or more functional teams.

The hazards of each individual task can generate additional risks when combined with other tasks, potentially compromising the safety of one operation due to the execution of another.

SIMOPS can involve multiple companies, large multi-disciplined workforces, and various operation activities, significantly increasing the risk level with potentially serious and sometimes disastrous consequences.

The interactions between activities have the potential to create undesired events or circumstances that can compromise safety and adversely affect people, the environment, assets, schedules, etc.

###### Purpose

During normal vessel operations, the vessel may be involved in multiple activities simultaneously. This procedure provides guidance on:

- Understanding SIMOPS

- Identifying SIMOPS

- Planning SIMOPS to mitigate risks before commencement

- Executing SIMOPS to prevent uncontrolled operations due to inadequate resources, competence, distractions, etc.

- Managing SIMOPS through elimination and minimization of risks with effective communication and supervision

###### Responsibilities

The Master: Overall responsibility for the SIMOPS

Senior Management on Board (Master, Chief Engineer, Chief Officer, and Second Engineer):

- Meet prior to the SIMOPS for planning and review

- Identify the SIMOPS to be carried out

- Determine the need for these operations

- Assess the constraints and hazards associated with all activities

- Establish corresponding mitigation measures such as responsibilities (Supervision and Verification)

- Define the time frame of each SIMOP activity

- Allocate resources in terms of manpower, PPE, redundancy against failures, adequate resources for multiple contingencies, prevention of fatigue, and minimizing risks of distraction

- Evaluate if carrying out one operation increases the risk to another operation

###### Handling Multiple Operations

Multiple operations expose the vessel to risks that need to be considered during the planning stage before commencing the operations. The goal is to identify, effectively prevent, and mitigate hazards.

The risks of inadequate resources, competence, and distractions could lead to uncontrolled operations, resulting in breaches in safety and environmental protection. Implement the key mitigation measures below when carrying out SIMOPS.

Record the steps in the relevant permit to work, plan, or toolbox meeting.

###### Identification of Operations

The following jobs normally take place concurrently, two or more at a time:

- Bridge Watchkeeping

- Engine Room Watchkeeping

- Tank Cleaning

- Cargo Hold Cleaning

- Cargo Operations

- Ship-to-ship Operations

- Maintenance of Equipment

- Hot Work

- Work Aloft or Overside

- Bunkering

- Receiving Stores

- Enclosed Space Entry

- Drills

- Third-Party Inspections (PSC, SIRE, CDI, Surveys, Vetting)

- Crew Change

- Diving Operations

Caution: Do not carry out simultaneous critical operations, such as enclosed space entry and navigation in confined waters, or hot work and cargo operations/tank cleaning, etc.

For any additional jobs beyond those listed, prepare a Risk Assessment (RA). Guidelines on the extent of RA are detailed at the end of the section.

##### HANDLING SIMOPS

###### Resource Availability

The management team should review the following resources:

- Supervisor: Ensure a qualified supervisor is assigned to each operation, as per SMS duties.

- Support Personnel: Sufficient support staff should be allocated independently for each operation, qualified as per their assigned duties in the SMS.

- Tools and Equipment: Sufficient tools and equipment should be available without compromising resources for other operations. Suspend SIMOPS if tools and equipment need to be shared.

- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): All staff involved must have sufficient PPE, including personal gas detectors, helmets, gloves, harnesses, safety lines, SCBA, and ELSA.

- Fire Fighting Arrangement (FFA): Ensure adequate firefighting resources are available for each operation, even if required at multiple locations simultaneously.

- Environmental Conditions: Ensure jobs are conducted under favorable conditions with adequate illumination, sea conditions, absence of noise, and adequate ventilation.

- Conflict of Resources: If one operation's resource requirements interfere with another, do not conduct SIMOPS.

###### Supervisor

Each operation should have a clearly identified supervisor who:

- Is qualified for the job.

- Is assigned as per SMS duties.

- Is thoroughly briefed on all concerned activities and roles.

- Supervises only one operation at a time.

###### Support Personnel

Split personnel into multiple teams, distributing persons with required knowledge and experience equally.

Each team should have independent responsibility and not require support from other teams doing SIMOPS.

Do not compromise manning requirements as per IMS. If unable to meet required levels, do not undertake SIMOPS unless a risk assessment (RA) has been done and approved by the office.

###### Communication Means

Ensure adequate communication means, such as walkie-talkies or VHF, are available for effective communication between support personnel and supervisors, and between supervisors and the control station.

Each deck staff should have a personal walkie-talkie.

Use different dedicated channels for each operation to avoid interference.

###### Distraction Due to Multi-tasking

Use separate teams, communication methods, and control stations for each task (e.g., Bridge, CCR, ECR).

Agree on clear instructions for handling alarms at common control points during planning.

Note:	In case multiple operations are likely to cause activation of alarm in common control points, such as Bridge, CCR and ECR, agree to clear instructions on handling of such alarm at the planning stage.

###### Fatigue Management

The shipboard management team shall review the rest hour compliance of each team during the planning stage and when allocating the duties.

If the operation is leading to significant breeches in the rest hour regulations, suspend the concerned operation till such time that the compliance can be maintained.

###### Contingency Planning

Identify the potential emergencies involved with the multiple operations and ensure a contingency plan is available and understood by all personnel for all planned operations. Each operation shall have a separate contingency plan.

The plan should involve suspension of all non- critical operations in the event of any emergency and ensuring that all resources as per the SMS are available for the contingency encountered.

###### Tool Box Meeting

- After formulating and approving the SIMOPS plan, conduct separate toolbox meetings for each planned operation.

- The toolbox meeting should follow the company SMS format, involve all concerned persons, discuss individual and team responsibilities, and cover all necessary precautions.

###### SIMOPS Approval

- The Master and senior staff on board should assess operations based on the criteria above and permit SIMOPS if the residual risk level is slight or minor.

- If the residual risk remains “medium” or above, seek office approval after identifying possible mitigating measures/procedures.

###### Suspension of SIMOPS

Suspend SIMOPS if:

- There is any change in the operating conditions from the original plan.

- Weather conditions deteriorate.

- Any contingency is initiated.

- It is necessary to carry out any critical operation.

###### Scope of Risk Assessment

- Conduct a risk assessment using company form HSEQ 06 for each SIMOPS.

- The RA should be detailed as per company procedure Ch. 8.07.

- Identify hazards for both operations when carried out independently.

- Assess each hazard further considering the simultaneous operation.

- Identify mitigating measures with clear responsibilities.

- Include contingency readiness and measures.

- Get RA approved by the office approval team if the residual risk remains “medium” or above.

### 5.3.13 Cold Weather Precautions - rev 0 issued 06.11.2024

##### COLD WEATHER PRECAUTIONS

###### Responsibility

The ship’s management shall be guided by the information contained below.

###### Cold Weather Precautions

Even if vessels are not ice classed or not trading constantly in sub-zero temperatures, crews may encounter cold weather occasionally.

Special attention should be given to the protection of:

- LSA equipment and systems: life rafts, lifeboats fuel, cooling systems, provisions

- FFA equipment and systems: fire/foam lines, freshwater lines, vents and flaps

- Inert Gas system: Deck Seal including its heating system, P/V Breaker, pneumatic controlled valves

- Cargo and ballast tanks venting system: P/V valves, ballast tanks vent heads

- Navigation systems: air horns/whistle, window wipers, window washing system

- Cargo gear: water seals, sampling lines, ODME system, AUS pumps

- Cargo heating system: steam lines, drains, valves

- Deck Air system: air lines, valves

- Deck machineries: hydraulic system (heating/warming), greasing

- Emergency Generator: fuel and cooling systems, fuel type, heating system

Each vessel shall follow a ship-specific Winterization Plan to prepare the vessel before arrival in cold weather areas.

Before arriving in cold weather areas, the master shall ensure that the Winterization Plan is followed and checklist HSEQ 13 – “Cold weather precautions” is completed.

####### Ballast Handling Guidance

- Seawater freezes around -1.5 °C (28 °F). Ensure only seawater ballast is retained onboard, i.e., exchange ballast if vessel caries low salinity ballast water.

- Avoid keeping ballast inside the tanks above the waterline.

- Ice blockage of vent heads and vent pipes can occur due to trapped water; ensure they are drained

Note: It is highly unlikely that any sizeable tank will freeze solid as ice acts as an insulating layer. However, ice represents a weight that may not be dischargeable when loading, reducing deadweight capacity.

- Open steam heating on all wing ballast tanks (where fitted), even in empty tanks, to prevent condensed water freezing.

- Open the Air bubbling system on ballast tanks (where fitted) to prevent freezing through continuous turbulence.

Note: Check the operating manual for limitations of the Air bubbling system in extreme cold climates.

To allow for expansion due to freezing, slack down freshwater tanks which are filled up.

For double bottoms used for main engine cooling, consider resultant stability loss if required to slack the tanks.

- Carry out ballasting and de-ballasting operations only after confirming air-pipes are clear. Monitor ballast pump gauges continuously.

- Ensure steam to heating coils in freshwater tanks is cracked open (if fitted) and monitor temperatures regularly.

- Note that ballast water does not freeze below the waterline, except when cargo hatches are open.

- Frequently activate hydraulic ballast valves in empty tanks to avoid freezing/blockage.

- Protect ballast tank vents from freezing with canvas covers or steam heating. Ensure vent covers can still operate as designed and remove them prior to cargo operations. Frequently remove accumulated ice.

- Determine the density of ballast water before entering cold climates. More saline water has a lower freezing point. Consider exchanging ballast water to increase salinity.

- Avoid freezing of ballast water surface by keeping levels at or below the sea surface level when possible. Use ballast tank heating or bubbling systems prior to entering sub-zero temperatures.

####### Cargo System Guidance for Tankers

Precautions to be taken may include:

- Testing the integrity of deck lines before use to ensure they are tight.

- Protecting equipment on deck with canvas covers, including hydraulic cargo and COW valves, COW/tank cleaning machines, P/V valves, mast riser vent valve, IG main and inlet valves, deep well pump motors, and shafts.

Verify that:

- Valves on deck are well greased and their gearboxes are free of water.

- Deck seal heating arrangements are operational.

- Anti-freeze levels in P/V breaker and stripping system vacuum pumps are correct.

- Cargo compressors requiring antifreeze and/or a heating system are identified and prepared.

Drain equipment, including:

- Cargo, COW, and tank cleaning lines and valves, after testing or use.

- Tank cleaning heater.

- Heating coils.

- Manifold drip-trays.

- Deck airline.

- Ballast system, including ballast monitor.

- Oil discharge monitoring system.

- Pumproom steam lines, if not in use.

Other precautions:

- Operate hydraulic cargo, COW, and ballast valves frequently to avoid freezing/blockage.

- Check P/V breaker, P/V valves, and flame screens before and during cargo operations.

- Start cargo pump and valve hydraulic systems before they are needed.

- Ensure deck seal heating is functioning and checked regularly during cargo operations.

- Remove canvas covers from ballast tank vents before ballasting/de-ballasting.

####### Deck Equipment Guidance

Periodic inspections of all deck machinery should be undertaken before arrival in cold areas and during exposure to sub-zero temperatures. Inspections may include:

Ensuring hydraulic systems contain a suitable grade of hydraulic oil. Continuously circulating hydraulic system oil when the external temperature is below 0°C.

Regular lubrication of equipment, such as winches and hatch covers. Operating and testing cargo handling cranes before entering sub-zero temperatures.

Checking heating arrangements are operational.

Covering pneumatic or electrical motors for accommodation ladders to prevent ice accretion. Closing the main air valve to the deck and draining the airline.

Protecting control boxes and motion levers for deck machinery with canvas covers. Protecting mooring wires and synthetic ropes with canvas covers until required for use. Proving winches, windlasses, and anchors to be operational before arrival in port.

Caution: Start hydraulic systems/power packs well in advance to warm up the oil to the required temperature (check instruction manuals).

These procedures shall form part of the ship-specific Winterization Plan.

### 5.3.2 Entry into Enclosed Space - rev 0 issued 06.11.2024

##### Entry Into Enclosed Spaces

###### Introduction

Enclosed Space Definition:

- A space with limited openings for entry and exit

- Inadequate natural ventilation

- Not designed for continuous worker occupancy

Dangerous Space Definition:

- Any enclosed or confined space where the atmosphere may contain toxic gases, flammable gases, IG (including nitrogen), or may be deficient or enriched in oxygen, posing health risks or causing death.

Note: No one should open or enter an enclosed space unless:

Authorized by the Master or the nominated Responsible Person

Appropriate safety procedures have been followed

An enclosed space entry permit should be issued and completed by the nominated Responsible Person, and authorized by Master before the personnel enters the space.

###### Responsibilities

Master:

- Supervise the implementation of pre-entry preparations and checks.

- Authorize the "enclosed space entry permit" (form HSEQ-09).

- Organize a work plan meeting prior to the commencement of work.

Note: a ship-specific list identifying actual shipboard enclosed spaces using form HSEQ 09B shall be available.

Competent Person:

- Designated as the Chief Officer and Second Engineer for deck and machinery spaces, respectively.

- Conduct a preliminary risk assessment to identify potential hazards and safeguards.

- Implement physical safeguards, including LO/TO systems for isolating cargo tank valves, hydraulic systems, and cargo pumps.

- Arrange physical barriers to prevent accidental opening of confined spaces.

Responsible Officer:

- Ensure pre-entry checks and preparations, including PPE checks, are done and documented.

- Confirm it is safe to enter the enclosed space.

- Implement risk-mitigating measures and ensure thorough ventilation of the space.

- Test the atmosphere at different levels for oxygen deficiency and harmful vapors.

- Ensure personnel are familiar with procedures and permit conditions are effective.

- Verify all crew entering the space are properly trained in entry procedures and IMS safety.

- Ensure the enclosed space entry permit is reviewed, signed, issued, filed, and posted.

- Establish and test a reliable communication system understood by all involved.

- Inform the duty officer or duty engineer of the entry operations.

- Conduct a toolbox talk with all parties on site.

- Ensure personnel understand to leave immediately if any gas detector alarm activates.

Person Entering the Space/Authorized Team Leader:

- Appointed as the team's most senior and experienced crew member, suitably trained.

- Ensure all persons entering the space are trained within the safety management system.

- Be familiar with identified hazards and safety measures with the responsible officer.

- Adhere strictly to the agreed entry procedure.

Attendant:

- A suitably trained crew member familiar with the ship's emergency procedures.

- Maintain a watch over those entering the enclosed space and communicate with them.

- Initiate emergency procedures if an incident occurs.

- Remain uninvolved with the work/operations inside the enclosed space.

##### The Hazards of Enclosed Space Atmospheres

One or more of the following conditions can make enclosed space atmospheres hazardous:

- Oxygen deficiency

- Toxic / flammable gases, including hydrocarbon vapors and toxic contaminants.

- IG, including nitrogen.

- Oxygen enrichment.

###### Oxygen Deficiency

When an enclosed space is left closed and unventilated, oxidation of steel (rusting) may reduce the oxygen within the space, causing the atmosphere to become oxygen deficient. The use of IG or nitrogen also reduces the oxygen content of a tank.

Increased Risk Factors:

- Spaces containing water.

- Damp or humid conditions.

- Spaces containing IG.

- Spaces adjacent to or connected to other inerted tanks.

- Cargo spaces with steel products or hazardous bulk cargoes with atmosphere-depleting properties.

The nominal oxygen level in fresh air is 20.9% by volume, with actual readings varying between 20.8% and 20.95%. Any space with an atmosphere below this should not be entered until the cause is identified and effective corrective measures are taken. People cannot detect oxygen deficiency and cannot react rapidly enough to escape or use emergency equipment, increasing the risk of incapacitation.

###### Presence of Toxic and/or Flammable Gases

Spaces that have previously contained toxic and/or flammable cargoes remain dangerous even after cleaning and testing.

Examples:

- Tank coatings (especially epoxy) absorbing and releasing vapors.

- Cargo residues in tank fittings, heating coils, or behind tank coatings releasing vapors.

- Cargo leaks into compartments, pumprooms, cofferdams, or adjacent tanks.

- Sludge and scale releasing gases if disturbed or heated.

- Cargo holds previously carrying fumigated grains or hazardous bulk cargoes liable to oxidation or emitting toxic fumes.

Precautions:

- Suspect toxic/flammable gas presence in empty tanks or compartments.

- Test ballast tanks or void spaces for hydrocarbon vapor and H2S before entry.

- Follow ISGOTT section 10.3 precautions for ballast water treatment systems, which may introduce gases such as hydrogen from electrolysis systems, chemicals, or ozone.

Note: Implement additional checks and precautions based on the ballast water treatment system installed, per the maker’s manual.

###### Risk from Inert Gas Including Nitrogen

IG from boiler flue gas or an IG generator may contain CO and CO2, both potentially deadly.

Details:

- CO is toxic and may be present in cargo tank atmospheres after gas freeing and in spaces containing IG plant components.

- CO2 is a smothering hazard requiring adequate ventilation to maintain normal oxygen levels (20.9%) and eliminate hazards.

- Nitrogen is colorless and odorless, causing oxygen deficiency in confined spaces and at exhaust openings during tank and void space purging.

Note: Exposure to nitrogen is dangerous and may cause euphoria before asphyxiation, often fatal with immediate effect.

###### Oxygen Enrichment

Even a small increase in oxygen levels can create a hazardous atmosphere, making it easier to start a fire that burns hotter, more fiercely, and harder to extinguish.

Main Causes:

- Oxygen enrichment from leaking equipment.

- Use of incompatible materials with oxygen.

- Use of oxygen in equipment not designed for oxygen service.

- Incorrect or careless operation of oxygen equipment.

- A leaking valve or hose in a confined space can quickly raise oxygen concentration to dangerous levels.

##### Identifying Enclosed Spaces

Unsafe atmospheres can develop in any space previously found to be safe and may also be present in nearby spaces where a hazard exists. Enclosed spaces include, but are not limited to:

Cargo spaces: Considering the cargo properties.

Tanks: Double bottoms, fuel tanks, ballast tanks, water tanks, slop tanks, L.O. tanks, waste oil tanks, sewage tanks.

Pipelines or fittings: Connected to any of these tanks.

Cargo rooms: Cargo pump rooms and cargo compressor rooms (if applicable).

Other compartments: Chain lockers, cofferdams, ducts or trunks (e.g., pipe trunks, cable trunks), void spaces, duct keels, inter-barrier spaces (if applicable).

Engine components: Engine crankcases, engine scavenge air receivers, engine room bilge, sludge and other tanks.

Other equipment: Pressure vessels, boilers, IG scrubber units.

Adjacent spaces: Connected to the above.

Note: Ducts or trunks should be considered enclosed spaces when paint work or similar work using volatile chemicals/fuels, where the possibility of toxic fumes exists.

Some spaces that do not meet the criteria for an enclosed space may have an unsafe atmosphere and although an Enclosed Space Entry Permit is not required, additional safety precautions must be implemented, such as:

- Inform OOW before entry

- Start ventilation at least 10 min prior entry (post a notice in the vicinity to this effect)

- Use personal gas detectors to test the atmosphere before and during entry

- Ensure availability of rescue equipment, if deemed necessary

Spaces that require above measures are:

- Forecastle store

- Paint lockers

- Battery lockers

- Ballast water treatment room

- Gas bottle storage lockers

- Carbon dioxide rooms

- Lockers within the cargo area

- Crane motor trunks

- Enclosed lifeboats

- Tank cleaning heater rooms

- Ballast pump rooms

- Deck tunnel/trunk space

- Other spaces in either the cargo or non-cargo deck area during operations may be identified by risk assessment.

  - This list is not exhaustive.

Procedures:

- Prepare a ship-specific list to identify actual shipboard enclosed spaces using form "HSEQ09B Ship Specific Enclosed Spaces."

- Post the ship-specific list on the bridge, engine control room, cargo control room, and in the enclosed space checklist file.

- Preventing Accidental Entry: Clearly identify all shipboard enclosed spaces with a WARNING SIGN, e.g., “Danger – Confined space. Do not enter without a permit to work” (or similar content).

The vessel shall identify all enclosed spaces onboard via a risk assessment process presented in Appendix I of this section. Reassess this risk assessment to ensure continued validity. Consider spaces in Appendix I as high or moderate risk (with a calculated risk of 12 or more) requiring enclosed space procedures prior to entry.

Note: If in any doubt, treat the space as dangerous.

##### Precautions For Entering Enclosed Spaces.

Before entering an enclosed space:

Assessment:

- Determine if the task can be achieved without entering the space.

- Ensure the atmosphere in the space can be made safe.

- Assess if there is any risk to safety of life or to the ship.

Preparation:

- Verify the atmosphere in the space is satisfactory.

- Conduct a risk assessment and fill out the form, discussing it with those entering the space.

- Plan and test rescue equipment and personnel.

Note: Personnel should be properly trained and regularly drilled in using the equipment, including for emergencies or tank rescues. Training should be done before entry to remove hesitation in using the equipment.

- Complete and issue the "enclosed space entry permit".

Entry Protocol:

- Use breathing apparatus only in an emergency.

Note: Using breathing apparatus is not an alternative to thorough preparation to make a space safe.

- Conduct an initial entry to ensure the space is safe for work. This should be done by one or two crew members, depending on the size and layout of the space, carrying an Emergency Escape Breathing Device (EEBD) and a personal gas monitor. Check the atmosphere thoroughly and record the results.

- Maintain ventilation and do not stop it while re-entry gas testing is carried out. If ventilation stops, evacuate the space and cancel the permit.

- Ensure everyone entering the space carries a personal multi-gas detector. Evacuate immediately if there is any doubt about oxygen levels or the presence of toxic or flammable gases.

Special Considerations:

- Continuously ventilate and monitor spaces for explosive and toxic gases during maintenance involving paints and paint thinners. Provide protective clothing for long-term exposure to toxic fumes and gases.

- Record any opening that affects the watertight integrity of the vessel (e.g., removal of a tank lid) in the deck logbook. The crewmember closing the space must report to the bridge, and an officer must inspect that the space has been secured properly.

- Familiarize all crewmembers with ISGOTT Chapter 10, ‘The Code of Safe Working Practices for Merchant Seamen,’ and the IMSBC Code Section 3 guidelines on entry into enclosed spaces.

- Always assume the space to be entered is hazardous until tested and proved safe.

###### Atmosphere Tests Prior to Entry

Enter an enclosed space only after testing the atmosphere comprehensively from outside using approved equipment that has been:

- Recently calibrated

- Checked for correct operation

Required Atmosphere Checks:

- Oxygen content should be 20.9% by volume.

- Hydrocarbon vapor concentration should be less than 1% LFL.

- No toxic or other contaminants such as H2S, CO, Benzene, etc., should be present.

- Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL) should be no more than 50% of the OEL for any toxic vapors and gases.

Note: Repeat the test after additional venting if necessary.

Caution: Do not enter until the atmosphere is confirmed safe.

Testing Protocol:

- Obtain measurements from a representative cross-section of the compartment by sampling at various depths and through as many deck openings as practicable.

Note: When testing from deck level, stop the ventilation and take readings after a minimum of about ten minutes.

Caution: Do not stop ventilation when people are in the space.

- Suspect pockets of gas even if tests show the space to be safe. Continuously ventilate while personnel are in the space.

- Be aware that hydrocarbon gas may regenerate after removing loose scale, sludge, or hazardous bulk cargo residues. Equip personnel with personal gas monitors for continual atmosphere checks.

- Lower the IG pressure of adjacent tanks, but keep it positive, to reduce leak possibilities. Remain alert for hydrocarbon or IG leaks from adjacent spaces or pipelines.

- Frequently check the atmosphere in large spaces during extensive work, especially at work locations and inaccessible areas. Test the atmosphere after any work interruption or break, ensuring the readings represent the entire space’s condition.

OEL values adopted by the Company for gases likely to be encountered on board, can be found below:

H2S		TWA* 5 ppm		STEL** 10 ppm

CO		TWA* 20 ppm		STEL** 100 ppm

CO2		TWA* 5000 ppm	STEL** 15000 ppm

Benzene	TWA* 1 ppm		STEL** 5 ppm

Mercaptan 	TWA* 0.5 ppm		STEL** -

SO2		TWA* 0.5 ppm		STEL** 1 ppm

Chlorine	TWA* -	0.5 ppm	STEL** -

*Long-term exposure limit (8-hr TWA reference period)

**Short-term exposure limit (15-minute reference period)

Note: Full list of gases can be found in the latest edition of EH40/2005 Workplace exposure limits.

###### Safeguards for Enclosed Space Entry

A Competent Person, either the chief officer or second engineer, should conduct a preliminary risk assessment to identify potential hazards and appropriate safeguards. Factors to consider include previous cargoes, ventilation, structure, coating type, and other relevant elements.

Cleaning Requirements:

- Clean cargo and bunker tanks according to HM 50 or T/C Software (for chemical tankers) until suitably clean for man entry using fixed or portable tank cleaning machines. Refer to IMS Ch. 16.2 for detailed instructions.

- Clean ballast tanks only if cargo or bunker migration has occurred. Refer to IMS Chapter 16.4 for guidance.

Risk Assessment:

- Review the task, personnel required, and emergency response needs.

- Determine the potential for hazardous atmosphere development due to leakage from adjacent spaces.

Preparation Before Entry:

- Ensure the space (cargo, bunker, ballast tanks) is cleaned based on previous content.

- Conduct appropriate atmosphere checks.

- Isolate/blank off all connecting pipelines, inert gas, ventilation systems, valves, and electrical/power equipment, and document or tag them.

- Maintain effective ventilation continuously while the space is occupied.

- Ensure fixed lighting (e.g., air-turbo lights) is ready for extended entry periods.

- Inspect all tools before use; do not use worn or damaged tools. Lower tools in a plastic bucket or canvas bag.

- Periodically test for gas and maintain continuous ventilation when removing hazardous residues.

Note: Gas concentrations may increase around the work area, so ensure the atmosphere remains safe.

- Have approved self-contained positive pressure breathing apparatus and resuscitation equipment ready at the entrance.

- Prepare a rescue harness with lifeline, fully charged safety torch, and other necessary equipment at the entrance.

- Ensure an Attendant is in constant attendance outside the space, in contact with a responsible officer, and trained for emergencies.

- Establish clear communication lines understood by all.

- Monitor and record names and times of entry by personnel.

Personnel Equipment: Use protective clothing, safety boots, safety helmet, gloves, safety glasses, safety harness (if climbing access), approved safety torches, UHF radio, personal or area gas detectors, and Emergency Escape Breathing Devices (EEBDs).

Atmosphere Testing: Test the atmosphere with properly calibrated equipment, following the manufacturer's instructions. Test before entry and at regular intervals (no more than 30 minutes and after breaks). Sample at various levels and locations for a representative atmosphere sample.

###### Enclosed Space Entry Permit

After initial gas testing, restart ventilation fans and keep them running throughout the entry period. Issue the permit for the full working day (8 hours), valid only if ventilation is not interrupted and permit conditions are met. The permit should be approved by someone other than the person making the entry.

Enter the space no later than 30 minutes after atmosphere testing, and test the atmosphere at 30-minute intervals, recording results on the permit. Continue ventilation during breaks and re-test the atmosphere before re-entry. Cancel the permit if ventilation stops or conditions change. Re-issue permits after emergencies with the same rigor as an initial entry.

Display the permit prominently at the entrance to inform crew members of precautions and activity restrictions.

- Select personnel based on experience, qualifications, and position on board. They must sign the hot work permit before the master’s review and approval.

- Those involved in planning hot work must review the “hot work permit” before the job starts.

###### Safety Precautions for Hot Work Planned in Enclosed Spaces

Follow these precautions helps reduce the risks associated with hot work in confined spaces like cargo tanks, bunker tanks, ballast tanks, void spaces, cofferdams, etc.

Cleaning: Remove any residues, sludge, or other combustible materials.

Ventilation: Maintain continuous forced ventilation during the work.

Gas-Free Testing: Ensure the tank is gas-free, ventilated, and free from flammable vapors or toxic gases.

Oxygen Level Check: Confirm oxygen is 20.9% before entering.

Entry Permit: Issue an Enclosed Space Entry Permit.

Firefighting Equipment: Place fire extinguishers and firefighting equipment nearby and ready for use.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Ensure all personnel wear appropriate PPE, including respiratory protection if needed.

Hot Work Permit: Obtain a hot work permit and ensure necessary approvals

Fire Watch: Assign a trained fire watch to monitor for sparks or other hazards during the work.

Isolation of Adjacent Spaces: Ensure all adjacent tanks and compartments are either inerted, gas-freed, or filled with water to prevent gas migration or ignition hazards.

No Smoking or Open Flames: Enforce strict no-smoking and no open flame policies near the hot work area and adjacent spaces.

Continuous Monitoring: Use gas detectors to continuously monitor the atmosphere within the tank and surrounding areas for any signs of flammable vapors.

Communication: Establish clear communication channels between the hot work team, bridge, and emergency response personnel.

Emergency Preparedness: Review and rehearse emergency evacuation procedures prior to beginning the work.

####### General Cleaning Requirements:

- Remove Flammable Materials: Sludge, cargo-impregnated scale, sediment, or any material likely to give off flammable vapors should be removed from the work area.

- Extent of Cleaning: Establish the cleaned area extent through a risk assessment. Pay special attention to the opposite sides of frames and bulkheads, and areas immediately below the work location.

The following table provides guidance regarding the radius of areas to be cleaned when preparing for hot work in cargo or bunkering tanks:

Heating coils should be flushed or blown through with steam to ensure they are clear of hydrocarbons.

####### Hot Work on Cargo and Fuel Oil Bunker Tanks

Safety Testing: Consider a fuel oil bunker tank safe if vapor space tests show less than 1% LFL.

Prohibited Areas: No hot work on tank bulkheads, or tank tops, within 500mm unless cleaned for hot work.

Compartment Preparation: Clean, gas free, and continuously ventilate the compartment where hot work will be performed.

Adjacent Cargo Tanks: Ensure they are either:

- Cleaned and gas freed with hydrocarbon vapor content reduced to not more than 1% LFL.

- Emptied, purged, and hydrocarbon vapor content reduced to less than 2% by volume and inerted.

- Completely filled with water.

Inerting: Inert all other cargo tanks below 2% VOL of HC.

Additional Cleaning: Clean the space on the other side of a tank bulkhead, or within 500mm of such a bulkhead, to meet hot work requirements.

IG Pressure: Reduce IG pressure to prevent uncontrolled venting during hot work.

Cargo Piping and IG Lines: Purge and isolate these to reduce hydrocarbon levels to less than 2% by volume.

Slops Management: Remove all slops from the ship or securely isolate them in a non-adjacent tank at least 30m from the hot work location.

###### Hot Work in Cargo, COW, and Bunkering Areas

Repair Process: Remove sections of pipelines, strainers, and valves for repair in the designated space whenever possible.

Permit to Work: Any breaking of lines should comply with the permit to work system for hazardous energy control.

On-Site Repairs: Use cold work to remove items needing hot work, blank off remaining pipework, and ensure items are cleaned and gas freed.

Ventilation: Provide continuous through ventilation of the pipeline with fresh air and monitor exhaust air for hydrocarbons.

Heating Coils: Flush or steam through heating coils to clear hydrocarbons.

Control Hazards: If hot work must be carried out:

- Wash tanks within a 30-meter radius, ventilate to a gas-free condition, and re-inert.

- Maintain similar conditions in tanks that can direct hydrocarbon gas into the hot work area.

- Keep other tanks inerted without water washing.

- In non-inerted ships, ensure all tanks are gas free, fill ballasted tanks with water up to the coaming, and set P/V valves to automatic mode.

Continuous Monitoring: Perform gas testing before and during hot work, and record gas concentration readings every 30 minutes.

Warning

Hot work is prohibited within 30 meters of a tank containing slops. Keep the slop tank battened down with P/V valves set to automatic mode.

Residues in Pipelines: Clean areas prone to gas generation from residues and deposits, and test gas venting systems for explosive gases every 2 hours.

####### Hot Work on Other Pipelines

Pipeline Isolation: Block off other ends leading to adjacent tanks using valves, blanks, or covers to prevent accidental flashback. Remove blanks or covers after repairs.

Cleaning: Flush, clean, and gas free the item to be worked on, regardless of whether it is removed from the hazardous area.

Service Lines: Small diameter service lines may be hot worked in place if clean, adjacent sections are disconnected, and open ends are covered to prevent flammable vapor emission. Preferably, remove to the E/R workshop unless no viable alternative exists.

Heating Coils and Manifolds: Steam out and blow through to ensure no hydrocarbon product is present.

####### Piping Cleaning Guidance

Miscellaneous Piping: Clean standpipes and "U" bends at the bottom of filling pipes by flushing from the deck level during initial and final stages of tank cleaning.

Heating Coils: Ensure no fuel or bunkers are in the heating coils. Steam is the only safe purging method, inerting coils within the work area. Continue steaming until oil signs disappear from return piping.

Note: Compressed air will not break down clingage on piping sides and may create a flammable atmosphere.

Vent Piping: Remove and clean vent pipes and heads of any bunker residues before hot work near or on the vent pipe and head to prevent fire hazards.

###### Hot Work Within Port Limits

Shore Workers: Engage a marine chemist to issue a “safe for Hot-Work” clearance when shore workers are engaged in hot work on board within port limits.

Ship's Staff:

- Check and comply with local regulations, including obtaining permission from port authorities.

- The issuance of a hot work permit by a shore chemist or port authority does not relieve ship’s staff from ensuring safe conditions for hot work.

- Comply with the company’s hot work requirements regardless of shore chemist permits.

- Read and understand the conditions of issuance on the shore permit, which often require maintaining a fire watch by trained ship's personnel.

###### Introduction

Anyone working where there is a risk of falling may be regarded as working at height. In addition to work on ladders, staging and scaffolding, this includes work inside a tank, near an opening such as a hatch, or on a fixed stairway. Further guidance is available in Marine Guidance Note MGN 410 (M+F) Amendment 2.

Anyone working and not standing on deck level is working at height.

Working at height (also known as working aloft) should be risk assessed and suitable control measures should be taken to protect people who may be at risk. Depending on the severity of the risk, a permit to work may be required.

Note: A Permit to Work Aloft (HSEQ 10) is required if the Risk Assessment Residual risk is higher than “slight”.

In any case, working at a height greater than 2.0 m should automatically require a Risk Assessment and a Permit to Work Aloft.

The required documentation / permits is dependent on the risks involved with the task, as per below:

Carry out work at height if there is no reasonably practical alternative to doing so.

Where a reasonably practical alternative does exist, it should be adopted.

Where work must be carried out at height, such work should be properly planned, appropriately supervised, documented and carried out in as safe a manner as is reasonably practicable, planning should include carrying out a thorough risk assessment.

Work over side only when the vessel is alongside or at anchor.

In case required to prepare boarding arrangements while vessel is still underway approaching a pilot station or berth such task may be undertaken with extra caution through risk assessment and in compliance with HSEQ 10 Working aloft-over side permit (see further guidance below at “Working Overside While Vessel is Underway”).

###### Definitions

Work aloft:  means work in any place where, if precautions are not taken, a person could fall and be injured.

Work overside: means work taking place outside permanent railings where there is a risk of a person falling into the sea.

### 5.3.8 Underwater Operations - rev 0 issued 06.11.2024

##### Divers’ Underwater Inspection and Repairs

###### Introduction

Underwater operations involving divers present unique safety considerations.

Routine ship operations like ballasting or testing steering gear are dangerous to divers.

During underwater work or surveys, divers are not visible to the crew, therefore maintaining communication with the divers and dive master is crucial.

###### Guidelines for Divers’ Underwater Inspection and Repairs

The company must authorize diver services, except in emergencies. Only qualified commercial diving operations are permitted.

Note: Diving companies performing in-water surveys must have certification of service suppliers issued by the Class.

Before any diver enters the water near the vessel:

- Rig code flag “A” indicating divers at work.

- If at anchor, inform nearby vessels about the start and finish of diving operations and warn any vessels entering or leaving the anchorage.

- In port, notify the appropriate port authority of the start and finish of diving operations.

- Assign a senior officer, typically the Chief Officer (C/O), as the diver safety officer to ensure safety precautions are implemented and followed while divers are in the water.

- The diver safety officer is the primary liaison between the vessel and the dive master. The master or repairs superintendent must remain onboard until inspections and repairs are completed.

- The vessel’s master, chief engineer, diver safety officer, and dive master must participate in a pre-dive safety conference and agree on communication procedures.

- Ensure efficient communication using walkie-talkies with the divers’ boat, Engine Room (E/R), and Officer of the Watch (OOW) before starting work. If communication fails, stop work and bring divers to the surface until communications are restored.

- Lock-out / tag-out required equipment to prevent accidental operation

###### Operational Precautions

Follow below guidelines:

- Inform divers if the Main Engine (M/E) turning gear is engaged before they enter the water.

- Do not jack the main engine and shaft while divers are in the water. Secure and isolate the main engine to avoid accidental propeller turning.

- Secure propulsion equipment, including bow and stern thrusters, to prevent shaft and propeller rotation. Place appropriate warning tags at control stations, bridge, starting air isolation valves, air or power supply, circuit breakers, and similar components.

- Advise divers of the location of hull penetrations, such as sea suctions and discharges. Secure unused sea suctions and discharges and place warning tags on each valve, pump control, and open circuit breaker. Only the diver safety officer may authorize the removal of warning tags.

- Do not change the system line-up or operate a sea water pump, including ballast pumps, without permission from the diver safety officer and dive master. Ensure all systems with idle hull penetrations are properly secured and tagged and inform the dive master and divers of the operating systems.

- Close and lash unnecessary overboard discharge and intake valves in the area of divers’ activities. Inform divers of any operational overboard discharge and intake and ensure no changes are made while divers are submerged.

- If a sea chest must be blanked-off, discuss the procedure with the company’s representative and get approval.

- Ensure inboard blank flanges fitted with drain cocks are ready for installation before removing the piece to be repaired. Test the outboard blank tightness before removal. If no drain valves are fitted, test by slightly slacking the back bolts on flanges.

- Close, lash, and tag all valves in the system under repair. The Chief Engineer (C/E) or Second Engineer (2/E) must attend the repair location during removal and replacement of the piece to be repaired. Keep the inboard blank flange under control to prevent leaks.

- Keep the main and emergency bilge pumps ready and test the bilge draining system before starting repairs.

- Secure the cathodic protection system before divers enter the water. The C/E must keep the cathodic protection disconnected until the underwater inspections/repairs are completed.

- Secure the steering gear and open the circuit breakers for each pump. Place warning tags on each open circuit breaker and on the bridge at the steering stand.

- Secure the echo sounder, doppler speed log, and any other underwater electronic devices, and open the circuit breakers. Place warning tags on each component and at the open circuit breakers.

The master or superintendent must review these procedures with the divers and ship personnel involved in the repairs before starting work.

These procedures should be followed together with any additional safety assistance or precautions required by the divers. All involved personnel must acknowledge understanding and compliance.

Caution: Always conduct a risk assessment before launching lifeboats or rescue boats.

####### Launching Procedure for Lifeboats Lowered by Means of Falls

General Guidelines:

- During drills, those responsible should be vigilant for potentially dangerous conditions and situations and should report them to the responsible person for appropriate action.

- A detailed risk assessment and required permits must be prepared and reviewed with all involved crew members in advance.

- The launch procedure must be discussed in detail and carefully planned.

Preparation: Ensure proper release of lashings or gripes before swinging out the davit to prevent entanglement. When performing drills, first lower and recover the boat without persons on board to verify correct function.

Boarding Methods for Lifeboat’s Assigned Operating Crew are detailed below.

Using a Service Boat:

    - Lowering

- Lower the boat into the water without the crew.

- Embark the crew via the service boat.

- Crew members take their seats and secure seat belts.

- Person in Charge (PIC) starts the lifeboat engine.

- PIC removes the safety pin of the release system and releases the lifeboat hooks, followed by the painter.

- PIC maneuvers the lifeboat in the water.

    - Recovering

- Reset the lifeboat hooks to the closed position.

- Reset the release mechanism to the closed position and insert the safety pin.

- Check that the indicators of the hooks show the closed position.

- Maneuver the lifeboat under the falls (attach painter at first opportunity).

- Once the boat is under the falls, the designated crew attaches falls to the hooks.

- Lift the boat just out of the water.

- Check that the hooks are still showing the closed position.

- Check that the hydrostatic release unit shows the closed position (red).

- Embark the lifeboat crew on the service boat.

- PIC requests the deck party to heave the lifeboat to its stowage position.

Note: When a service boat is not available, and after considering prevailing conditions and completing a risk assessment, the Master may consider the following option.

Lowering/Recovering with Fall Preventers Attached:

    - Lowering

- Install fall preventers.

- Crew embarks, takes their seats, and secures seat belts.

- PIC lowers the lifeboat to about 1-1.5 meters above the sea surface by means of a remote wire inside the lifeboat and stops.

- PIC starts the engine.

- The crew removes the fall preventers and returns to their seats.

- PIC lowers the lifeboat into the water and releases the hooks, followed by the painter.

- PIC maneuvers the lifeboat in the water.

    - Recovering

- Reset the lifeboat hooks to the closed position.

- Reset the release mechanism to the closed position and insert the safety pin.

- Check that the indicators of the hooks show the closed position.

- Maneuver the lifeboat under the falls (attach painter at first opportunity).

- Once the boat is under the falls, the designated crew attaches falls to the hooks.

- Lift the boat just out of the water.

- Check that the hooks are still showing the closed position.

- Check that the hydrostatic release unit shows the closed position (red).

- Attach the fall preventers.

- The crew takes their seats and secures seat belts.

- PIC requests the deck party to heave the lifeboat to its stowage position.

Additional Notes: The lifeboat operating crew shall consist of one Deck Officer, one Engineer, and two ratings. The lifeboat maneuvering exercise in the water should take place while the vessel is safely anchored.

Drill Conditions: If the captain considers the drill can be safely carried out while the vessel is adrift, permission from the Office shall be sought. The exercise can be postponed if weather conditions are unsafe or if not allowed by port authorities. In such cases, the master must:

- Notify the responsible MSI, giving the reasons for the postponement.

- Maintain an appropriate record in the Official Logbook regarding the reason the exercise could not be carried out.

- Request the Office to arrange a Flag dispensation.

- Carry out the lifeboat exercise at the earliest opportunity.

To avoid the drill becoming overdue, the Master should look for an opportunity to carry out the next drill after 1.5 months have elapsed since the last event. When crew members are required to work on davit hooks or blocks, they should follow procedures for working aloft, including completing Checklist HSEQ 10.

####### Launching Procedure for Free Fall Lifeboats

Monthly Drills: Ensure that persons who will enter the lifeboat in an emergency are trained to embark the boat, take their seats correctly, and use the safety belts. Instruct them on actions to take during launching into the sea.

Quarterly Launching: Launch the lifeboat every three months as part of a drill. Perform controlled launching without personnel on board, using secondary means of lowering. Maneuver the lifeboat in the water by the operating crew.

Semi-Annual Launching: At intervals of no more than six months, either:

- Launch the lifeboat by free fall with only the operating crew on board.

- Conduct simulated launching as per SOLAS III.19.3.3.4.

Alternative Semi-Annual Simulated Launching: Instead of the six-monthly free fall launch, simulate launching using approved equipment provided by the manufacturer at intervals of no more than three months as per LSA Code IV/4.7.6.4.

Boarding for Tests: The assigned operating crew shall board the lifeboat by means of a rescue boat and perform the required tests.

Recovery: Recover the boat without personnel on board.

Notes:

Always ensure detailed risk assessments and required permits are prepared and reviewed with all involved crew members in advance.

Properly discuss and carefully plan the launch procedure.

####### Procedure for 6-Mo Simulation Launching of Lifeboat

Free Fall Lifeboats shall not be launched by the free fall method but by simulation only. Simulated launching should only be carried out with lifeboats and launching appliances designed to accommodate it and for which the manufacturer has provided instructions. Simulated launching should be carried out under the supervision of a responsible person who should be an officer experienced in such procedures.

A typical simulated launching sequence comprises the following recommended steps:

Pre-Launch Checks: Check equipment and documentation to ensure all components of the lifeboat and launching appliance are in good operational condition. Ensure the restraining device(s) provided by the manufacturer for simulated launching are installed and secure, and that the free-fall release mechanism is fully and correctly engaged.

Communication: Establish and maintain good communication between the assigned operating crew and the responsible person.

Disengage Securing Devices: Disengage lashings, gripes, etc., used to secure the lifeboat for sea or maintenance, except those required for simulated free-fall.

Crew Boarding: The participating crew boards the lifeboat and fastens their seatbelts under the supervision of the responsible person. All crew, except the assigned operating crew, disembark the lifeboat. The assigned operating crew fully prepares the lifeboat for free-fall launch and secures themselves in their seats for the release operation.

Activation of Release Mechanism: The assigned operating crew activates the release mechanism when instructed by the responsible person. Ensure the release mechanism operates satisfactorily and, if applicable, the lifeboat travels down the ramp to the distance specified in the manufacturer’s instructions.

Re-Securing the Lifeboat: Re-secure the lifeboat to its stowed position, using the means provided by the manufacturer, and ensure the free-fall release mechanism is fully and correctly engaged.

Disembarking: The assigned operating crew disembarks the lifeboat.

Returning to Normal Condition: Ensure the lifeboat is returned to its normal stowed condition. Remove any restraining or recovery devices used only for the simulated launch procedure.

Notes:

Simulated launching should only be carried out with lifeboats and launching appliances designed for it.

Ensure all checks and preparations are thoroughly completed to maintain safety.

Follow manufacturer’s instructions strictly during the entire procedure.

### 5.5.2 Pilot Ladder Safety - rev 0 issued 06.11.2024

##### Pilot Ladders

###### Introduction

Pilot ladders on board ships are critical for safely embarking and disembarking pilots, enabling them to navigate vessels through restricted or high-traffic areas.

Constructed to strict international standards, these ladders must ensure the highest levels of safety and reliability.

The Master shall:

- Ensure the availability of a properly maintained means of pilot embarkation and disembarkation

- That the ladder is positioned, rigged, checked and manned in accordance with IMO recommendations and, where applicable, local requirements.

The Pilot shall:

- Use appropriate personal protective equipment; and

- Liaise with the Master so that the ship is positioned and manoeuvred to permit safe boarding.

The following sections outline the specifications, use, and maintenance requirements for pilot ladders on board, ensuring they are compliant, functional, and always ready for safe pilot transfer.

###### Pilot Ladder Safety

The requirements for pilot ladders are governed by Regulation 23, Chapter V of SOLAS.

To eliminate accidents related to pilot ladders, ensure they:

- Are made of the required material as per guidelines.

- Are properly maintained.

- Are correctly used and rigged.

A competent person, such as an officer or the bosun, shall oversee rigging/recovering the pilot ladder.

A risk assessment and required work permits (e.g., Work Aloft Permit) must be issued before commencing the job.

The rigging operation shall be observed/supervised by the Master or the OOW from the bridge. During pilot transfer, a deck officer shall oversee the operation on deck, and the Master from the bridge.

###### Construction of the Pilot Ladder

Pilot ladders cannot be manufactured or repaired on board.

They must be certified by the manufacturer as complying with SOLAS, Chapter V/Reg.23 or ISO 799-1:2019.

Note: Keep a record of the date the ladder was placed into service.

Identification: Pilot ladders must be clearly identified with a tag or permanent marking. The bottom of the top step and the bottom of the lowest spreader step shall be marked with:

- Name and address of the manufacturer

- Manufacturer’s model designation

- ISO 799-1 and SOLAS

- Year of assembly or reassembly

- Identification of the approved maritime safety administration

Maintenance and inspections:

- Keep ladders clean,

- Inspect ladders before each use

- Inspect ladders regularly as per PMS instructions

- Remove ladders from service if damaged

- Replace the ladder after 30 months in service

###### Rigging Pilot Ladders

The rigging of the pilot transfer arrangements and the embarkation of the pilot shall be supervised by a responsible officer who shall:

- have means of communication with the navigation bridge and

- arrange for the escort of the pilot by a safe route to and from the navigation bridge.

Personnel engaged in rigging and operating any equipment shall be instructed in the safe procedures to be adopted and equipment shall be tested prior to use.

In all ships, where the distance from sea level to the point of access to the ship exceeds 9 meters, a combination ladder shall be arranged.

Ensure compliance with requirements for steps, spreaders, ropes, side ropes, and step distances as depicted in below sketches:

###### Use of Pilot Ladders

1. Handholds:

Provide adequate handholds at the point of embarking/disembarking on each side, between 0.7 m and 0.8 m apart, rigidly secured to the ship's structure.

Handholds should be at least 32 mm in diameter and extend at least 1.2 m above the deck.

2. Ropes:

Use only Manila ropes, which remain non-slippery. Minimize exposure to seawater, sunlight, and chemicals. Store ropes in covered locations when not in use. Clean ropes after exposure to seawater and inspect them for wear and tear before each use.

Note: Visual inspection can sometimes give a false indication of the rope's condition and strength.

3. Steps:

Open and lay the pilot ladder on the deck before each use. Inspect for missing wedges, cracking, and damage. Ensure steps are secured firmly, equally spaced, and always horizontal.

4. Shackles:

Use shackles with equal strength and durability as the side ropes.

5. Lifesaving Equipment:

Ensure availability of:

- A lifebuoy with light near the boarding area

- Two-man ropes (28-32 mm diameter) if required by the pilot

- A heaving line

- Adequate lighting of the transfer area

6. Stowage:

Secure the pilot ladder after use and store it in a dry, well-ventilated space, clear of the deck, and covered to protect from sunlight, chemicals, and paint spills.

Use pilot ladders solely for personnel embarkation and disembarkation.

Caution: Do not use pilot ladders for other purposes like draught reading or maintenance work.

Record the maintenance and inspection of pilot ladders in the logbook or PMS software, when available.

####### Requirements for Use of Pilot Ladders

A well-maintained pilot ladder must be used correctly to ensure safety. Permanent markings should be provided at regular intervals (e.g., every 1 m) throughout the ladder's length to facilitate rigging to the required height.

1. Location of the Pilot Ladder Deployment Area

According to SOLAS, the pilot ladder shall be rigged:

- Clear of possible discharges from the ship (e.g., scupper discharge).

- Within the parallel body length of the ship and as far as practicable, within the midship half-length.

- With all steps resting firmly against the ship's side.

- With two man ropes not less than 32 mm in diameter, made of manila rope or other material that provides a firm grip, if requested.

- With handhold stanchions and bulwark ladders, if required.

2. Securing the Pilot Ladder to the Ship

The top portion or head of the pilot ladders should be secured by deck-mounted strong points.

Note: The strong points should be at least as strong as the pilot ladder’s side ropes, with a minimum strength of 24 kN for each side. The SWL should be marked.

If the pilot ladder is stored on a winch, it should not hang from the winch and must be secured on the deck with shackles.

For ships with a freeboard over 9 meters, a combination arrangement must be used for pilot embarkation. In this case, the pilot ladder and man-ropes need to be secured about 1.5 meters above the bottom platform of the accommodation ladder.

Some ships have permanent arrangements on the ship's side to secure the pilot ladder. Others may use portable magnets to secure the pilot ladder.

Pilot-Ladder-Magnet IMPA Code: 232093~95

When securing the pilot ladder, consider the following:

- If secured at its ends, the pilot ladder can be secured with appropriate shackles.

- For intermediate lengths, use a rolling hitch knot.

Caution: Do not secure the ladder at intermediate lengths using shackles, as this is dangerous.

- Ensure the pilot ladder step is not resting on the fish plate, as it can snap down under weight.

- None of the pilot ladder steps should rest on any ship structure.

There have been incidents where improperly secured pilot ladder steps snapped, causing pilots to fall. Proper warning should be given if the ladder is secured incorrectly.

For ships with a freeboard over 9 meters using accommodation ladders in conjunction with pilot ladders:

- The accommodation ladder's angle of slope should not exceed 45 degrees, and it should be at least 600 mm wide.

- The lower platform should be horizontal and secured to the ship's side, at least 5 m above sea level.

- The pilot ladder should be rigged adjacent to the lower platform, extending at least 2 m above it, with a horizontal distance of 0.1 to 0.2 m between them.

During the night, the entire length of the pilot ladder, access points, and egress should be well illuminated.

A lifebuoy with a self-igniting light and a heaving line should be kept ready.

A responsible officer shall supervise the rigging and embarkation of the pilot, ensuring associated safety equipment like life jackets, harnesses, lifelines, and lifebuoys are in place.

3. Access to Deck

Once the pilot boards the ship, the area where they first step needs to be clear. According to IMO Resolution A.1045(27), this area should be:

- 915 mm in length measured longitudinally along the ship’s length

- 915 mm in width measured inward from the ship’s side

- 2200 mm in height measured from the main deck

Pilot-access-area

As a good practice this area is marked on the deck on each side of the ship.

###### Emergency procedure

Embarkation of Pilot or any other person via the pilot ladder shall be supervised by an Officer. All Officers shall be aware of the actions to be taken in case of an incident.

In case a person falls of the Pilot ladder:

- Throw the lifebuoy with light in the vicinity of the victim

- Inform Bridge immediately

- If the vessel is underway the Bridge Team shall follow “EMER 16 – Man overboard – recovery of people form water- search and rescue” check list

- Maintain permanent visual contact with the person in the water

- Ensure adequate lighting

- Prepare the equipment required for the recovery of the persons from the water

- Coordinate with the pilot/service boat the recovery of the person

- Inform local authorities

- Render any assistance necessary

2 (Two) toxic gas detectors or analyzers suitable for the range of products being carried

5 (Five) personal gas detectors capable of measuring concentrations of O2, HC, CO, and H2S to be used for enclosed space entry, for monitoring the atmosphere on deck and in the pump room during cargo operations, or for specific deck/engine room jobs

1 (One) portable pump to be used with chemical testing tubes (e.g., Draeger tubes) and sufficient chemical gas testing tubes suitable for the products being carried

Note: Above equipment is supplied automatically and maintained by a Contractor on a two year cycle. Each instrument is delivered with a Calibration Certificate valid for two years.

Dry Cargo Vessels:

2 (Two) personal gas detectors capable of measuring concentrations of O2, HC, CO, and H2S to be used for enclosed space entry, for monitoring the atmosphere on deck and in the pump room during cargo operations, or for specific deck/engine room jobs

Note: Vessel shall maintain sufficient inventory of calibrations gas bottles, specific to the equipment available on board.

Caution: Do not use personal or toxic gas detectors/analysers to measure gas concentrations in an inert/oxygen-deficient atmosphere, due to possibility of damaging the instrument/measuring cells. Use only chemical testing tubes or equipment designed for this purpose (e.g RX 8700).

Note: Tankers must carry onboard chemical testing tubes listed in form TANK 19. Chemical tankers must carry onboard, in addition to the inventory required by form TANK 19, chemical testing tubes suitable for the cargoes being carried.

###### Portable Gas Monitoring Equipment Failure

The vessels are supplied with portable gas monitoring equipment in excess of the requirements, for redundancy.

In case of breakdown of one or more portable gas monitoring equipment prior to entering a port:

- Inform the Gas Detecting Equipment Contractor and the Company

- Ensure that the remaining equipment is tested, calibrated and ready for use

- Ensure that personnel that can be exposed to toxic gases is provided with a personal gas detector (i.e. the deck watchkeepers)

- Rearrange the duty roaster on deck if required (i.e. number of deck watchkeepers)

The contractor / company shall arrange delivery of replacement units as soon as possible.

###### H2S and Toxic Gases

Many crude oils come out of the well with high levels of H2S, but a stabilization process usually reduces this level before the crude oil is delivered to the ship.

However, the amount of stabilization may be temporarily reduced at times, and a tanker may receive a cargo with an H2S content higher than usual or expected.

In addition, some crude oils are never stabilized and always contain high levels of H2S. Some refined products such as naphtha, fuel oil, bunker fuels, bitumens, and gas oils may also contain H2S.

Cargo and bunker fuels should not be treated as free of H2S until after they have been loaded and the absence of H2S has been confirmed by both the results of monitoring and the relevant MSDS information (ISGOTT 2.3.6.1).

Vessels carrying H2S cargo must have onboard dedicated and certified personal devices for measuring H2S, sufficient for every crewmember working on exposed decks/areas (ISGOTT 2.3.6.4).

The chief officer should keep an adequate supply of chemical indicator tubes (e.g., Draeger tubes) specific to the cargoes being carried, and they should be within their expiry date.

Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all gas analyzers and chemical indicator tubes.

###### Calibration and Testing of Portable and Personal Gas Analysers

####### Definitions

Bump Test (Function Check): A qualitative function check where a test or span gas is passed over the sensor(s) at a concentration and exposure time sufficient to activate all alarm indicators to present at least their lower alarm setting. The purpose of this check is to confirm that gas can reach the sensor(s) and that all the alarms present are functional. This is typically dependent on the response time of the sensor(s) or a minimum level of response achieved, such as 80% of the gas concentration applied.

Note: This check is not intended to provide a measure of calibration accuracy.

Calibration Check: A quantitative test utilizing a known traceable concentration of test or span gas to demonstrate that the sensor(s) and alarms respond to the gas within the manufacturer’s acceptable limits. This is typically plus/minus 5-10% of the test gas concentration applied unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer or a regulatory agency.

Full Calibration: The adjustment of the sensor(s) response to match the desired value compared to a known traceable concentration of test gas. This should be as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

####### Frequency of Calibration, Testing, and Inspection/Maintenance

Follow these instructions:

- Calibrate instruments monthly on board

- Inspect/maintain equipment monthly as per manufacturer instructions

- Check equipment before each use; perform a bump test

Note: If the bump test does not pass, calibrate the instrument.

- Perform zero calibration before each use and always after the instrument was exposed to:

- High concentrations of gas

- Extreme conditions such as rough handling or possible physical shock

- Overexposure to concentrations of target gases

Any portable gas monitor that fails a bump test (function check) or calibration check must be adjusted by means of a full calibration procedure before further use or removed from service.

All instruments will be changed on a two-year cycle and will be accompanied by a Calibration Certificate released by the Contractor.

####### Record Keeping

Maintain an “Inspection and Calibration Log” for all personal and portable gas detectors. Record all calibrations and tests of ullaging, pressure, temperature, and atmospheric monitoring equipment in the “Inspection and Calibration Log.” For this purpose, use the following forms:

TANK 25 - CARGO MANOMETERS CALIBRATION (TEST) RECORD

TANK 26 - ULLAGE COMPARISON RECORD

TANK 27 - PORTABLE AND MANIFOLD THERMOMETERS CALIBRATION (TEST) RECORD

TANK 32 - TEMPERATURE SENSOR INSPECTION & CALIBRATION RECORD

TANK 33 - REFERENCE PRESSURE GAUGE INSPECTION & CALIBRATION RECORD

##### Fixed Gas Detection System

###### Introduction

Tankers are normally equipped with fixed gas detection systems for testing the atmosphere in:

- Ballast tanks, double bottoms, and void spaces

- Cargo pump rooms

- Accommodation air intake

Set the alarms for the fixed gas detection system to activate as follows:

- HC at 10% LEL

- Oxygen at 19% Vol

- H2S at 5 ppm

Ensure that the officers are familiar with the meaning of these alarms and know the actions to take if they are activated.

###### Monitoring Tanks/Void Spaces using Fixed Gas Detection System

Vessels provided with a fixed Gas Detection System for the Ballast Tanks and Void Spaces shall:

- Maintain the system permanently in operation

- Off scan sampling points of tanks that contain ballast water to avoid ingress into the system

Note: where high and low sampling points are provided, select the appropriate sampling point to avoid off-scanning

- Record times when a sampling point is off-scanned/scanned in the Cargo Logbook

- Use form Tank 54 to maintain daily atmosphere check results

Note: when a ballast tank HC monitoring is off scanned due to being partially filled with ballast water, measurements of HC should be taken using a portable instrument daily, and recorded in form TANK 54.

###### Failure of a Fixed Gas Detection System

Tankers where a failure of the Fixed Gas Detection System occurs shall follow below guidance:

- Inform Company

- Carry out a Risk Assessment

- Initiate a Management of Change procedure

- Implement required alternative management methods identified in the MoC and RA

- Record the defect in PMS

- Issue a request for necessary spares and service

- Obtain, via Office, a Flag Dispensation

- Inform and obtain permission from the arrival port authorities to conduct port operations

Implement below mitigating measures (these should be included in the RA and MoC, amongst others):

Tankers where the Fixed Gas Detection System for the Ballast Tanks and Void Spaces failed, shall monitor Ballast Tanks and Void Spaces atmosphere using a portable gas detector and record the results:

- At sea – daily in form TANK 54

- In port – every four hours in Cargo Logbook

###### Tankers without a Fixed Gas Detection System

Tankers not provided with a Fixed Gas Detection System for the Ballast Tanks and Void Spaces shall monitor Ballast Tanks and Void Spaces atmosphere using a portable gas detector and record the results:

- At sea – daily in form TANK 54

##### Inerting Double Hull Spaces

###### Introduction

Double-hull spaces are fitted with suitable connections for the supply of inert gas as per SOLAS II-2/4.5.5.1.4.1.

These include all ballast tanks and void spaces of double-hull and double-bottom spaces adjacent to the cargo tanks, including the forepeak tank and any other tanks and spaces under the bulkhead deck adjacent to cargo tanks, except cargo pumprooms and ballast pump-rooms.

Inerting double hull space is applicable, but not limited to, migration of cargo with high RVP (volatile) and applicable to large cargo leaks.

Double-Hull Spaces Inerting Procedure

C/O shall follow below steps when an HC alarm is generated by the Fixed Gas Detection System:

- Measure the atmosphere of the space using a portable gas detector to re- confirm presence of HC in the double hull space

- If confirmed, STOP all operations (e.g. cargo, bunkering, work on deck)

- Check the electrical continuity of the inerting hoses and record the results.

- Purge the main IG line with inert gas before connecting the hoses to the double hull space.

  - Note: To minimize the transfer of hydrocarbon vapor from cargo tanks, temporarily close all cargo tank IG supply valves.

- Install the inerting hose.

- Remove one vent head from the space and install the dedicated P/V valve

Note: Use portable standpipes where necessary, fitted with flame arresters, to ensure the P/V height is at least 2 m above deck level.

- Seal off any other free tank vent.

- Inert at the lowest possible speed

Note: Inert gas is heavier than air and will fall to the bottom. Vent through the P/V valve.

- Inert until oxygen concentration is less than 8% Vol.

- Maintain the atmosphere at positive pressure by the P/V valve.

- Check the atmosphere periodically and top up IG as required.

Caution: Strictly comply with all electrostatic precautions throughout the inerting process and for 30 minutes afterward.

Completed

##### Disposal of Empty Calibration Gas Canisters

Empty canisters should be safely and appropriately disposed of in compliance with relevant regulations. If required, they can be landed ashore for safe disposal.

On vessels provided with a dedicated canister puncture tool, after ensuring that the canister is completely emptied in a safe area, the tool can be used to puncture it. This should only be carried out in a safe, open area. Punctured canisters can then be disposed of as ordinary waste or scrap.

##### Control of Oil and Oil Products Discharges

Marpol Annex I regulation 34 lists the conditions in which oily mixtures can be disposed into the sea.

Warning!

Any discharge of oil or oily mixtures with an oil content greater than allowed by regulations to sea is prohibited.

Marpol Regulation 34 - Control of discharge of oil

Discharges outside special areas:

Subject to the provisions of regulation 4 of this Annex and paragraph 2 of this regulation, any discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixtures from the cargo area of an oil tanker shall be prohibited except when all the following conditions are satisfied:

- the tanker is not within a special area.

- the tanker is more than 50 nautical miles from the nearest land.

- the tanker is proceeding en route.

- the instantaneous rate of discharge of oil content does not exceed 30 litres per nautical mile.

- the total quantity of oil discharged into the sea does not exceed for tankers delivered on or before 31 December 1979, as defined in regulation 1.28.1, 1/15,000 of the total quantity of the particular cargo of which the residue formed a part, and for tankers delivered after 31 December 1979, as defined in regulation 1.28.2, 1/30,000 of the total quantity of the particular cargo of which the residue formed a part; and

- the tanker has in operation an oil discharge monitoring and control system and a slop tank arrangement as required by regulations 29 and 31 of this Annex.

Caution! Any discharge to sea of oil or oily mixtures in the Special Areas, as defined by Marpol Annex I, is strictly prohibited

###### Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment (ODME)

Introduction

Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment (ODME) is a system used on ships to monitor and control the discharge of oil and oily mixtures into the sea. Its primary purpose is to ensure compliance with international regulations, particularly those set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), such as the MARPOL Convention.

Key functions of ODME include:

- Monitoring: The ODME continuously measures the oil content in the effluent being discharged from the ship.

- Recording: It keeps a detailed log of all discharges, including the quantity and oil content, which is essential for regulatory compliance and inspections.

- Control: The system is designed to automatically stop the discharge if the oil content exceeds permissible limits.

- Alarm Systems: ODME typically includes alarms that alert the crew if there are malfunctions or if the discharge exceeds allowable levels.

Overall, ODME systems play a crucial role in preventing marine pollution and protecting the marine environment.

The system requires following data input:

- vessel’s speed - from the GPS

- flow rate – from the flow meter

- oil ppm content – from the ppm content meter (measuring cell)

When conditions of Marpol Reg 34, points 4 & 5 are satisfied the ODME will automatically allow the disposal of oil water.  Whenever any of these two conditions are not met the ODME will cease the discharge.

There are two types of discharges that need to be monitored and controlled by the ODME:

- Slop Tanks wash water (residues resulting from Oil Cargo Tanks washing)

Discharge must comply with Marpol Reg 34

Instantaneous rate of discharge of oil is not more than 30 ltr/NM

Total quantity discharged to ensure that it is not more than Total Qtty of cargo from which the oil formed part /30,000

- Clean Ballast (ballast water loaded in COW-ed or cleaned Cargo Tanks)

Marpol Annex I Regulation 34 does not apply

Marpol Annex I, Regulation 1-17 applies

The vessel must have the ODME in operation and the instantaneous concentration of oil discharged to sea should not exceed 15 ppm

Operation of ODME Procedure

The Chief Officer or designated officer shall do this:

Set the total oil quantity that can be discharged in ODME.

Allow a minimum of 36 hours settling time.

Note: The time required for oil and water to separate in the slop tank depends upon the motion of the ship as well as on the type of previous cargo. Under favourable conditions, a few hours may be enough, but in most circumstances, 36 hours or more should be allowed.

Comply with all other conditions of MARPOL Annex I, Reg 34.

Prepare ODME for operation:

Check if the inlet and outlet valves for the flow meter are open.

Ensure fresh water supply is available, and all valves are open.

Check if sample line inlet and outlet valves are open.

Verify that the air supply for pneumatic valves is on.

Ensure power supply available for all system components.

Manually rotate the sample pump shaft to check if it is free to move.

Ensure values for flow rate, speed, and PPM are in auto mode and not in manual mode.

Take an accurate reading of ullage and oil/water interface.

Note: Depending on the quality of oil in the slop water, consider preliminary heating of the slop tank contents as a management method to enable efficient separation of oil from water and accurate oil/water interface reading.

WARNING!

If unable to determine an oil/water interface level, do not commence de-sloping operations. Inform the office to obtain further advice.

Start the cargo pump in recirculation mode.

Note: If you see unusual values, such as high PPM of oil in the sample, stop the pump and start a cleaning cycle manually.

WARNING!

If the ODME is not operational, do not discharge slops/clean ballast to sea. If ODME operation is suspected to be abnormal, interrupt the discharge and investigate. Inform the office.

Start overboard discharge.

Note: After completing and verifying all the above steps, start the ODME to commence overboard discharge. During the first phase, the bulk discharge, use the rate of discharge corresponding to the maximum rate as per ODME design.

Monitor during the entire overboard discharge operation:

Post a lookout in the vicinity of the overboard valve to visually monitor the quality of effluent discharged.

Caution! - Stop the operation if oil sheen on the sea is reported.

Monitor the oil concentration in discharged water (ppm), and the instantaneous rate of discharge (IRD); if IRD is close to 30 L/NM (or 15 ppm for clean ballast), reduce the pump speed to reduce the flow.

Note: With a reduced flow rate, the IRD will also reduce.

Discharge the slops at the maximum permissible discharge rate until the water interface reaches about 20% of the tank’s depth

Stop the overboard discharge and take an oil/water interface and ullage reading to recalculate the volume of remaining water.

Resume pumping out slop tanks at the minimum possible rate (the final discharge phase) until 1 m sounding of water (interface level) remains in the tank.

Note: To achieve a minimum rate, use either a stripping pump, where fitted, or a cargo pump at minimum revolutions.

Stop the overboard discharge.

Note: Stop the overboard discharge manually when any of the following occur:

The interface level is reached.

Rapid increase in PPM occurs. You can continue if you are sure that the oil/water interface is still far away.

An oil sheen is seen on the sea surface.

WARNING!

If the ODME interrupts the operation multiple times, verify the equipment. If necessary, allow a further 24 hours of settling time before starting the ODME again.

Perform the cleaning cycle.

Note: Each time the ODME is stopped, a cleaning cycle will start. If it does not start automatically, start the cleaning cycle manually.

Close all the valves and system.

###### Failure of ODME Guidance

As per MARPOL regulations, in case of failure of ODME sensors, discharge slops under the following regulations.

Caution! - Consult the office first if required to follow the regulations below.

MARPOL Regulation I/31 details the requirements for the automated use of the oil discharge monitor with slop tanks during the cleaning operation of cargo tanks of existing tankers.

Provisions must also be made for emergency manual control of the effluent discharge in case of failure of the ODMCS.

IMO Resolution MEPC.108(49), as amended, contains the full revised guidelines and specifications for oil discharge monitoring and control systems for oil tankers constructed on or after 01 January 2005, including the 2013 amendments set forth in MEPC.240(65).

For tankers constructed before 2005, the equipment and systems may comply with the earlier standards contained in IMO Assembly Resolution A.586(14).

MARPOL Regulation I/31.2 states:

“Any failure of this monitoring and control system shall (automatically) stop the discharge. In the event of failure of the oil discharge monitoring and control system, a manually operated alternative method may be used, but the defective unit shall be made operable as soon as possible. Subject to allowance by the port State authority, a tanker with a defective oil discharge monitoring and control system may undertake one ballast voyage before proceeding to a repair port.”

Additionally, per MARPOL Regulation I/36.6, all failures of the oil discharge monitoring and control system shall be noted in Part II of the Oil Record Book. Section 6.11.1.1 of Resolution MEPC.108(49), as amended, clarifies these reporting requirements to ensure complete and proper reporting of any such instances.

According to Report MEPC 36/22, paragraph 9.40, the phrase “before proceeding to a repair port” means a laden voyage following a ballast voyage.

If the ODMCS fails during tank cleaning while the tanker is en-route to a loading port, the cleaning may continue as long as a planned and documented manual method of monitoring and logging the discharge is utilized.

The vessel may then make one (1) loaded voyage after which the ODMCS must be repaired at the discharge port. If the repairs cannot be completed at the discharge port, the vessel may be allowed one (1) voyage directly to a port where ODMCS repairs can be accomplished.

Furthermore, per MEPC 36/22, paragraph 9.40, such a voyage should only be acceptable under the following conditions:

An oil discharge monitoring method must be manually operable.

The vessel must provide documentary records in the Log Book or the Oil Record Book or in the vessel's planned maintenance record that the system has been maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.

The equipment has been utilized and records are available verifying the use of the unit during all ballast discharges prior to the present functional defect and that this defect has been duly recorded in the Oil Record Book.

Prior to arrival at the unloading port, the failure has been reported to the authorities (port State and classification society).

Every reasonable effort has been made to repair the defective unit prior to the vessel departing from the unloading port.

Caution! In case of ODME sensor failure follow the manual operation instructions available in the Operation Manual of the ODME.

Warning!

If the Oil Content Meter fails (the measuring Cell) – do not discharge slops to sea

Upon failure of the ODME, discharge of effluent into the sea via the ODME must stop, and an entry must be made in the Oil Record Book.

In case of ODME failure that cannot be rectified on board], the port State of destination, the Classification Society, and Flag Administration must be immediately notified.

The vessel’s owners/operators should also be notified, and immediate measures should be taken to have the ODME repaired by a qualified service engineer.

###### Carriage of Ballast Water in Oil Cargo Tanks

Do not carry ballast water in cargo tanks except:

- On those rare occasions when weather conditions are so severe that, in the opinion of the master, it is necessary to carry additional ballast water in the cargo tanks for the safety of the ship.

- In exceptional cases:

- Where a vessel is required to pass under a low overhead bridge.

- When local port and canal regulations require a specific draft for safe navigation.

- If such tanks have been crude oil washed or thoroughly cleaned, as per the requirements of Marpol.

##### Discharges of Noxious substances (Marpol Annex II)

###### Introduction

The discharge of noxious liquid substances (NLS) from chemical tankers is strictly regulated under MARPOL Annex II to safeguard marine ecosystems.

This annex classifies substances into four categories—X, Y, Z, and OS (Other Substances)—based on their potential environmental hazard, with Category X being the most harmful.

Discharge operations must meet stringent requirements, including permissible discharge rates, minimum distances from shore, and specific water depths.

These regulations require precise monitoring, use of approved discharge equipment (Annex II underwater overboard discharge arrangement), and thorough record-keeping in the Cargo Record Book to document all discharges.

This ensures that chemical tankers operate within international standards, minimizing environmental impact and supporting sustainable maritime practices.

Warning!

Any discharge in Antarctic Special Area is forbidden.

###### Management of Slop Tanks

Consider the compatibility of various cargoes and cleaning chemicals when handling slops on board. Take care when washing several tanks that have contained dissimilar cargoes, and consider compatibility when selecting the destination tank for stripped wash water.

Avoid the following:

- Mixing of slops from MARPOL Annex I cargoes with slops from MARPOL Annex II cargoes

- Mixing of slops from incompatible cargoes

- Mixing of slops from vegetable oils or fats with chemical or petroleum slops

If one or more of the ship’s cargo tanks are used as slop tanks, take care to avoid introducing slops from cargoes that may not be compatible with the tank coating.

###### Disposal of Annex II Tank Washings

Dispose of tank washings from MARPOL Annex II cargoes as per the requirements of Annex II Category X, Y, and Z cargoes, contained in Regulation 13 of Chapter 5.

Where regulations permit the discharge into the sea of Category X, Y, or Z products, the following shall apply:

- The vessel must be proceeding en route at a speed of at least 7 knots

- The discharge must be made below the waterline.

- The vessel must be at least 12 nm from the nearest land

- The depth of water must be not less than 25 meters

There are two methods for washing with chemicals: Injection and Recirculation. The PSD of the chemical used will specify the most suitable water source to be used (FW or SW).

Pre-wash a tank that has carried a Category X product before leaving the port of discharge. Clean the tank until the effluent, measured by a cargo surveyor, is at or below 0.1% by weight. When the required concentration is reached, empty the tank to the reception facility. Discharge any water subsequently introduced into the tank into the sea as per MARPOL Annex II.

Discharge Category Y or Z products as per MARPOL Annex II, except for high viscosity or solidifying Category Y products. Pre-wash high viscosity or solidifying Category Y cargoes as per the requirements for Category X substances above. Discharge any water subsequently introduced into the tank into the sea as per MARPOL Annex II.

A high viscosity substance is a Category Y substance with a viscosity equal to or greater than 50 mPa-s at the unloading temperature. A solidifying substance is one which:

In the case of a substance with a melting point of less than 15°C, is at a temperature of less than 5°C above its melting point at the time of unloading

In the case of a substance with a melting point equal to or greater than 15°C, is at a temperature of less than 10°C above its melting point at the time of unloading

Category OS substances are considered to present no harm to marine resources, human health, amenities, or other legitimate uses of the sea when discharged from tank cleaning or deballasting operations, and they are not subject to the requirements of MARPOL Annex II.

###### Carriage of Ballast Water in Cargo Tanks on Chemical Tankers

Ballast from a cargo tank that contained a Category X or Y substance, and which has been washed to such an extent that the ballast contains less than 1 ppm of the substance previously carried may be discharged into the sea without regard to the discharge rate, ship’s speed, or outlet location. However, the vessel must be not less than 12 nm from the nearest land and in water at least 25 meters deep.

Note:	Discharge into the sea of clean ballast is not subject to any of the requirements of MARPOL Annex II.

### 6.2.3 Garbage - rev 0 issued 15.11.2024

##### Garbage Management

###### Introduction

The Garbage Management procedure is an essential part of the vessel’s Integrated Management System, aimed at ensuring compliance with MARPOL Annex V and promoting sustainable waste handling practices on board.

This procedure outlines the methods for the collection, storage, processing, and disposal of garbage generated during vessel operations. The goal is to prevent marine pollution, protect marine life, and uphold the highest standards of environmental responsibility.

Amendments to MARPOL Annex V were adopted at MEPC 70 and entered into force on 1 March 2018. These changes include criteria for determining whether cargo residues are harmful to the marine environment and a new Garbage Record Book format with a category for e-waste.

###### Overview of discharge provisions MARPOL ANNEX V

Under MARPOL Annex V, the areas of: the Mediterranean Sea; the Baltic Sea; the Black Sea; the Red Sea; the Gulfs area; the North Sea; the Antarctic area; and the wider Caribbean region (including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea) are provided with a higher level of protection than other sea areas. Further information on special areas can be found in circular MEPC.1/Circ.778/Rev.1.

The en route requirement does not apply to the discharge of food wastes, where it is clear that retention on board presents an imminent health risk to the people on board. See MARPOL Annex V, Regulation 7.2.1.

The discharge of introduced avian products, including poultry and poultry parts, is prohibited within the Antarctic special area (sea area south of latitude 600S), except where those introduced avian products are incinerated, autoclaved or otherwise treated to be made sterile.

When in port, check with the port authority as local regulations may also apply. The above restrictions do not apply to the wash down of cargo residues from deck areas of vessels undertaken for safety purposes including:

Safe operation of a helicopter within the landing area and its immediate vicinity to avoid dust being raised by the down-draft of the rotors

Where there is a need to avoid navigational hazards such as dust being blown onto the wheelhouse or bridge wings

Where residues may cause a serious safety hazard to personnel if spillages are not cleaned from deck areas, adjacent walkways and working areas.

Cargo residues are considered to be harmful to the marine environment if they are residues of solid bulk cargoes which are classified according to the criteria of the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). See Resolution MEPC.295(71) 2017 Guidelines for the Implementation of MARPOL Annex V for further information.

Discharge is permitted where conditions (a) and (b), as follows, both apply: (a) both the port of departure and the next port of destination are within the special area and the ship will not transit outside the special area between theses ports; and (b) if no adequate reception facilities are available at these ports. See MARPOL Annex V Regulation 6.1.2.

Vessels at anchorage for a period of time with empty holds may discharge hold bilge water through the ships’ fixed piping bilge drainage system as long as the water is not directly related to a hold washing/cleaning operation.

If a threat to human health and safety of the crew or the remaining live animals on board exists, discharge to take place greater than or equal to 12 nautical miles from the nearest land.

Cleaning agents or additives in cargo hold, deck and external surfaces wash water are considered harmful to the marine environment if it is a 'harmful substance' in accordance with the criteria in MARPOL Annex III; and contains any components which are known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic (CMR). See Resolution MEPC.295(71) 2017 Guidelines for the Implementation of MARPOL Annex V for further information.

##### Prevention of Pollution from Garbage

###### Introduction

This procedure covers the handling and disposal of garbage.

- Strategies for Cost-Effective and Environmentally Sound Results:

- Reduction at source.

- Reusing or recycling.

- On-board processing (incineration where permitted).

- Discharge into the sea where permitted.

- Discharge to a port reception facility (preferred).

When requisitioning stores and provisions, encourage suppliers to remove and reduce packaging to limit the generation of garbage on board ships. Return the packing materials to the supplier whenever possible.

When garbage is generated aboard a ship, procedures are defined to enable the crew to sort materials that can be reused on board or recycled at an appropriate port reception facility.

Ship's garbage consists of distinct components, some regulated under MARPOL Annex V and others that may be regulated locally, nationally, or regionally. Evaluate each garbage component to determine the best management practice.

###### Responsibilities

###### Compactors

Compaction reduces the volume of garbage, facilitating shipboard storage and discharge of the material at port facilities.

The C/O shall:

- Assign a Compactor Operator

- Train the operator in the use of the equipment

- Prepare and discuss a Risk Assessment for the use of the compactor.

Compactor Operator shall:

- Be familiar with the use of the equipment

- Be familiar with the contents of the Risk Assessment

###### Garbage Management Plan

Every ship is provided with a ship-specific garbage management plan that contains details regarding:

- Collection.

- Sorting.

- Storage.

- Processing.

- Discharging.

- Recording in the Garbage Record Book.

- Training of crew.

All crew shall be familiar with the contents of the Garbage Management Plan and follow the instructions provided therein.

###### Sanitary Products

For vessels with female crew members, a separate garbage bin must be kept for the disposal of sanitary products, which must be properly disposed of onshore.

Toilets will have sanitary bins lined with sanitary bags.

A female crew member will be responsible for emptying the sanitary bins and disposing of the contents into the assigned garbage bin.

##### Dry bulk cargoes

MARPOL Annex V Compliance

Cargo Residues are leftovers after loading/unloading.

If classified as Harmful to the Marine Environment (HME), such residues cannot be discharged into the sea except under limited circumstances and must be discharged to an onshore waste reception facility.

Classification and Declaration

Solid bulk cargoes (excluding grain) are classified per Appendix I of MARPOL Annex V and declared by the shipper as harmful or not to the marine environment.

Note: Refer to International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code for required declarations.

Cargo Residues Management

- HME Cargo Residues cannot be discharged into the sea.

- Non-HME Cargo Residues can be discharged into the sea if the ship is en-route and not less than 12 nautical miles from the nearest land.

- Minimization of cargo residue wash down and discharge is part of the ship’s garbage management plan.

Implications of MARPOL Annex V

- Storing Wash Water in Cargo Holds may affect ship stability due to the free surface effect and cause structural damage due to sloshing.

- Storing Wash Water in Ballast Tanks may damage pumps, piping systems, and coatings, and may lead to non-compliance with the Ballast Water Management Convention discharge criteria.

Classification of Cleaning Agents/Additives (Res. MEPC 277(70))

- Shippers must notify the competent authority of the port state of loading about the classification of used cleaning agents/additives

- Cleaning agents/additives in wash water can be discharged into the sea if not classified as HME.

- HME Substances are identified as marine pollutants in the IMDG Code or if meeting criteria in MARPOL Annex III.

Port Reception Facilities (PRF) Inadequacy

- Ports and terminals must ensure adequate PRF availability, especially for HME cargoes within Special Areas.

- Information on PRF can be found at http://gisis.imo.org/Public/

Operational Aspects

- After unloading, sweep up cargo residues and wash holds to avoid safety hazards and contamination.

- Discharges should be recorded in the Garbage Record Book Part II as garbage Category J & K.

Note: Cleaning requirements for common solid bulk cargoes is provided in Appendix 1 of the IMSBC Code.

Declaration of Cargo Residues

- All ships must follow MARPOL Annex V requirements when discharging cargo residue.

- Cargo residues include remains, excess, or spillage of cargo that is not covered by other MARPOL Annexes, on the deck or in the holds of a ship, in wet or dry conditions, or mixed in wash water after loading, unloading, and onboard handling.

- Cargo residues do not include cargo dust remaining on the deck after sweeping or dust on external surfaces of the ship, or cargo material in the cargo hold bilge water, provided the material is not harmful to the marine environment and the bilge water is discharged through the ship’s fixed piping bilge drainage system.

Ships at anchorage with empty holds may discharge hold bilge water if the water is not directly related to a hold cleaning operation.

Cargo residues must be completely cleaned before sailing and delivered to the intended cargo space or a waste reception facility. Shipboard areas where spillage is common must be protected for easy residue recovery.

###### Management of Spills in Holds (Containers/Packaged Goods)

Damaged packaged cargoes are treated as residues/wastes under MARPOL Annex V. Additional requirements and guidance are found in MARPOL Annex III and the IMDG Code.

Damage to containers can cause spillages, depending on the product type and amount, reactions with other spillages, and whether the spill is on deck or in enclosed spaces.

Packages/containers with marine pollutants should bear a marine pollutant mark.

Disposal of spillage is at the Master’s discretion, prioritizing ship and crew safety and environmental impact. Marine pollutants washed overboard must be reported immediately to the nearest coastal state.

Regularly check cargo hold bilges for spillage indications. Follow procedures for collecting, retaining, and disposing of the spillage, observing precautions for entering enclosed spaces.

###### Deck Wash Down - Australian Requirements

Deck wash is permitted within 12 NM but limited to the following:

- Clear helicopter landing areas to avoid dust from rotor down-draft.

- Avoid navigational hazards like dust on the wheelhouse or bridge wings.

- Address safety hazards to personnel from residues on deck, adjacent walkways, and working areas.

Document these in the exceptional discharge or loss of garbage section of the Garbage Record Book as evidence.

##### Ban on Single Use Plastics in Some Countries

###### Introduction

Indian Directorate General of Shipping (DGS) issued Order No.05 of 2019 prohibiting the use of single-use plastic items onboard ships. The order prohibits the carriage of any such items onboard Indian flagged ships while foreign flagged ships are only prohibited from using any such item while operating in Indian waters.

From 1 January 2020, Kuwait also prohibits the use and discharge of single use plastic products onboard its ships and for ships calling at its ports

###### Single-use plastics requirements

Definition of Single-Use Plastics:

Single-use plastics are "disposable plastics used only once and then discarded." This does not include plastic items reused on ships. Examples of single-use plastics include:

- Cutlery, plates, and cups

- Bottles up to 10 liters for water and other drinks

Note: Oil Spill response equipment list as per SOPEP / SMPEP / VRP (Tankers) / NT-VRP (Dry Cargo vessels)

Crewmembers:

- Act carefully to prevent oil pollution incidents.

- Fulfil duties efficiently in case of oil spills.

###### Definitions

Oily Bilge Water: Water contaminated by oil from leakage or maintenance work in machinery spaces. Includes any liquid entering the bilge system such as bilge wells, bilge piping, tank top, or bilge holding tanks.

Oil Residue (Sludge): Residual waste oil products generated during normal ship operations. Includes waste from the purification of fuel or lubricating oil, separated waste oil from oil filtering equipment, waste oil collected in drip trays, and waste hydraulic and lubricating oils.

Caution! Do not mix oil residues/sludge with oily bilge water in holding tanks with the intent to discharge overboard after separation via the OWS system. Oily bilge water can mix with oil residues in the sludge tank, but the entire mixture must then be handled as oil residues/sludge and not discharged overboard via the OWS.

Note: There should be no interconnection between the sludge tank and any bilge pump with a direct overboard connection. The sludge pump should be independent, suitable for high viscosity liquids, and have no interconnection with other pumps or tanks. Sludge can be discharged to reception facilities or burned in an approved type incinerator or suitable combustion boiler.

##### Handling of Oily Bilge Water

Procedures:

Oily bilge water can be:

- Collected in a holding tank and subsequently discharged to shore facilities

- Separated using an oily water separator (OWS) and disposed to sea as per Marpol Annex I regulations

Warning!

Do not discharge oily bilge water into the sea without using the OWS.

Connection of unapproved or temporary piping to the bilge system is illegal and punishable by law.

Marpol Environmental Tagging System:

- Any unlawful connection to the E/R oily bilge water system is controlled by using tag seals. The C/E maintains a record of seal numbers and their locations as per the Plan.

- Manage all other MARPOL Tag System seals as per the instructions given in the MARPOL Tag System Plan.

###### Control of the OWS Overboard Valve

Chief Engineer Responsibilities:

- Ensure a tamper-proof sealing system is provided for the OWS overboard valve, ensuring it cannot be operated without permission.

- Control the operation of the overboard valve and use numbered seals to prevent unauthorized connections to the piping system that could lead overboard.

- Seal(s) should be properly attached to ensure they would break if a valve, valve handwheel, or pipe flange is removed. If a single seal is insufficient, use several seals or an additional chain combined with seals.

- Lock and seal the OWS overboard discharge valve, making a relevant entry in the TAG log book and ORB (under I code).

- Report any malfunction of the OWS or OCM immediately to TSI following the defect procedure and critical equipment and system protocol.

Warning

Display warning notices near the overboard discharge pipe to ensure the overboard valve is not operated without C/E and Master permission.

##### Oily Water Separator (OWS)

Purpose: Ensure systems used to transfer bilge or oily water mixtures for retention on board or discharge to deck prevent oil or oily mixtures from being discharged into the sea.

Prohibition of Direct Discharge:

- Do not use direct overboard discharge for daily accumulations from machinery space bilge.

- Maintain the ship's side valve and overboard pipework free of oil contamination and sealed to prevent unauthorized discharge.

- The emergency bilge overboard discharge should not be used for daily machinery space bilge accumulations. Inspect the ship's side valve and overboard pipework for oil contamination.

- The emergency bilge suction valve should be accessible and clearly marked.

- Use numbered environmental tags to prevent unauthorized discharge. Record tag numbers in the Tag Log held by the master and chief engineer.

Chief Engineer Responsibilities: Personally responsible for the pipeline system on the ship. Report any deviations from the pipeline diagram to the company.

Warning

Crew must not alter OWS piping or bypass sensing equipment. The company has a zero-tolerance policy for illegal piping and unauthorized discharge of oil. Offenders will be dismissed and reported to authorities.

Pipeline System Changes: Changes to the pipeline system are allowed only in exceptional circumstances. Proposals must be approved by the vessel’s technical director and the classification society. Approved modifications must be surveyed and endorsed by a class surveyor.

Piping Requirements: Piping to and from sludge tanks and sludge pumps must have no direct overboard connection, except the standard discharge connection (MARPOL 12/2).

Equipment Breakdown:

- In case of breakdown of the OWS, make an entry in the Oil Record Book (Part-I) under CODE – F/19.

- Notify the company’s DPA and/or Technical Department without delay.

- Post a warning notice on the equipment and do not use it until repaired.

- Record the failure and repair in the Oil Record Book (Part-I) under CODE – F/20 and 21 and the Engine Room Logbook.

- Investigate the cause of failure.

- Seal the overboard valve and post a warning notice.

OWS Operation Procedure

Note! - Discharge oily mixtures into the sea only in compliance with MARPOL Annex I, Reg 15.

Each time the OWS is used to dispose of bilge water to sea as per regulations, the C/E shall:

- Check with the OOW that it is permissible to perform the operation

- Inform the Master, who shall give permission to conduct the operation

- Open the OWS overboard valve.

- Record the event in the MARPOL Tag System logbook (i.e., breaking the seal number).

Prohibitions: Do not mix oil residues or sludge with oily bilge water for disposal through the OWS. This is prohibited. Oily bilge water may be mixed with oil residues and sludge for handling as sludge.

Disposal to Shore Reception Facility: Dispose of oily waste to authorized shore reception facilities only through the standard connection or other methods contained in IOPP Form B.

Incineration of Oily Waste and Sludge: Waste oil or sludge may be incinerated with the master’s approval in an approved incinerator. The chief engineer shall document the disposal of sludge in the ORB and attach the receipt to the ORB.

Disposal of Sludge Procedure

The chief engineer is responsible and will ensure that the disposal of sludge is properly carried out and documented in the oil record book.

- When transferring sludge within the ship from one tank to another or pumping oily bilge water to a dirty water tank, check all relevant valves. Ensure all relevant overboard discharge valves are properly shut to avoid accidental discharge. Monitor all operations throughout.

- Request the vessel’s superintendent or the technical manager in writing for approval to transfer sludge to the slop tanks. Make such requests only if slop tanks are empty. The manager will approve in writing.

- If sludge is transferred to the slop tank, record the transfer in Oil Record Books part 1 & 2.

Caution: Transfer of sludge to slop tanks containing cargo is strictly prohibited.

- Maximize the incineration of sludge.

- Raise the temperature of the sludge to be supplied to the boiler burner to the correct level, drain off any water, and then homogenize.

- Drain water from any sludge to be discharged to shore facilities and increase the temperature to facilitate pumping.

- If sludge is to be pumped ashore or to a barge, follow the same precautions and procedures as for bunkering and use the ‘Bunkering Checklist’ from company forms.

- Contact the technical superintendent to arrange for the disposal of sludge, which shall be carried out in full compliance with local regulations by authorized contractors only. Some charterers undertake to remove sludge at their own expense.

- Any proceeds from the sale of sludge belong to the company and shall be credited to the ship's cash account.

- Discharge all tank washings from fuel, sludge, or oily bilge water tanks to a shore facility.

- Many shore facilities are reluctant to accept mixtures.

Note: Confirm arrangements for disposal before adding chemical cleaners to a tank.

- Obtain a signed and stamped receipt or certificate stating the quantity, time, and date of sludge transferred ashore from the shore facility and annex it to the oil record book.

##### Emission Control Areas

###### Introduction

In 1997, a new annex was added to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). The regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships (Annex VI) seek to minimize airborne emissions from ships (SOx, NOx, ODS, VOC shipboard incineration) and their contribution to local and global ai r pollution and environmental problems. Annex VI entered into force on 19 May 2005 and a revised Annex VI with significantly tightened emissions limits was adopted in October 2008 which entered into force on 1 July 2010.

Amendments to MARPOL Annex VI Reg 14.1 in force since 1 January 2020 requires that the Sulphur content of any fuel oil used or carried for use on board a ship shall not exceed 0.50% m/m.

Amendments to MARPOL Annex VI Reg 14.3 in force since 1 March 2020 requires that for a ship operating within an emission control area, the Sulphur content of fuel oil used on board that ship shall not exceed 0.10%.

The international regulatory regime for air emission limitations from ships is regulated through provisions of Annex VI to MARPOL 73/78 Convention. As from 1 January 2015, MARPOL Annex VI will require that the maximum Sulphur content in fuels used by ships in ECAs shall be of 0.10% by weight.

Emission Control Areas (ECAs) - Currently, there are four IMO approved ECA regions:

- The Baltic Sea

- The North Sea

- The North American ECA , – 200 nautical miles offshore USA and Canada, including Hawaii, St. Lawrence Waterway and the Great Lakes

- The United States Caribbean Sea ECA

In addition, there are also

- China Domestic ECA area – around coast of China & Hainan

- Taiwan ECA – around Taiwan ports

The EU Sulphur Directive which is a replica of MARPOL Annex VI provisions but it has an additional provision requiring ships to use fuel with a Sulphur content of maximum 0.10% when “at berth” (including at anchor) in the EU ports. This provision is applicable in EU ports located outside these two current ECAs.

###### Baltic Area ECA

The Baltic Sea area (regulation 14.3.1 of MARPOL Annex VI and regulation 1.11.2 of MARPOL Annex I): "The Baltic Sea area means the Baltic Sea proper with the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland and the entrance to the Baltic Sea bounded by the parallel of the Skaw in the Skagerrak at 57°44.8' N"

###### North Sea ECA

The North Sea area (regulation 14.3.1 of MARPOL Annex VI and regulation 1.14.6 of MARPOL Annex V): "The North Sea area means the North Sea proper including seas therein with the boundary between:

- The North Sea southwards of latitude 62°N and eastwards of longitude 4°W;

- The Skagerrak, the southern limit of which is determined east of the Skaw by latitude 57°44.8΄ N;

- The English Channel and its approaches eastwards of longitude 5°W and northwards of latitude 48°30΄N."

###### North American ECA

The North American area (regulation 14.3.2 and appendix VII of MARPOL Annex VI):

"The North American area comprises:

- The sea area located off the Pacific coasts of the United States and Canada.

- The sea areas located off the Atlantic coasts of the United States, Canada, and France (Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon) and the Gulf of Mexico coast of the United States.

- The sea area located off the coasts of the Hawaiian Islands of Hawai΄i, Maui, Oahu, Moloka΄i, Ni΄ihau, Kaua΄i, Lāna΄i, and Kaho΄olawe.

Ships require to be compliant with the new ECA emission limits corresponding to the use of a marine fuel with a maximum 0.10% Sulphur content. US ECA requirements contain alternate compliance provisions:

- The ECA allows the use of scrubbers

  - The CARB requirements for fuel that meets the specs for distillate fuels.

Vessel operators will need to provide information on their emission control strategy, including the following:

  - For vessel operators using scrubbers:

- Information describing the equivalent emissions control technology being employed (i.e. open and/or closed loop exhaust scrubber), and

- Any available measurement data that the operator has on the emissions of diesel particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen and Sulphur oxides from the vessel with the equivalent emission reduction strategy being employed.

Note:	This documentation should include the vessel’s International Air Pollution Prevention (IAPP) certificate and attachments where applicable.

For vessel operators using non-distillate fuels at or below 0.1% Sulphur content:

- Identify the fuel type being used (e.g. marine fuel grade under ISO 8217), and ISO or ASTM specifications the fuel meets, as applicable.

- Provide any additional data the operator has on fuel properties that may impact emissions of diesel particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen and Sulphur oxides.

Areas for air quality control

Emission Control Areas (ECAs)

Vessel Speed Reduction (VSR) Areas

The air quality control initiatives in South Korea consist of two parts:

####### Sulphur restriction

1) From 1 September 2020 it is mandatory to use fuel with max. 0.1% Sulphur content while berthing.

Vessels will be required to use max 0.1% Sulphur fuel when berthing/anchoring for the times set out below:

- Berthing: 1 hour after completion of berthing until 1 hour before de-berthing.

- Anchoring: 1 hour after completion of anchoring until 1 hour before leaving anchor.

2) From 1 January 2022: It will be mandatory to use fuel with max. 0.1% Sulphur content while navigating ECAs.

####### Speed reductions

The port areas selected will be designated as “VSR program Sea Areas”. Each Sea Area will span 20 nautical miles in radius, measured from a specific lighthouse in each port.

Ships should navigate no faster than a maximum speed of 12 knots for container ships and car-carriers, 10 knots for other ship types, when moving from starting point to an end point within a Sea Area, see table:

S

1) Ships included in the program:

Ships covered under for the VSR Program differ at each port, but must be over 3,000GT and among the top 3 “fine dust- emitting” ship-types (see chart above).

2) Lower speed pays off:

Under the VSR Program, ships will have their port facilities fees lowered when they enter defined port areas at speed levels as defined above. For affected ships, port entry/leave fee (current 111 KRW per ton), will be discounted. The discount ceiling will differ between the ports. Container ships, for example, which traditionally enters port at relatively high speeds, will enjoy up to a 30% discount, while other ships will be granted a 15% discount.

###### Recommendations

Shipowners and operators should be aware of the following regulations:

South Korean ECA - From 1 September 2020, ships berthing or anchoring at certain Korean ports (South Korean ECA), must use max. 0.1% Sulphur content fuel (or reduce emissions below this target). From 1 January 2022 this limit also applies when navigating the ECA area.

### 6.3.6 Engine Power Limitation EPL - rev 0 issued 15.11.2024

##### Engine Power Limitation (EPL)

###### Introduction

As per EEXI regulation, Engine Power Limitation (EPL) is a system to improve a ship's energy efficiency by limiting the ship's engine power within the optimum engine setting. This results in limiting the ship's speed. Only EEXI non-compliant vessels (Attained EEXI > Required EEXI) will be equipped with EPL.

###### Types of EPL

There are two types of EPL:

1. For the Conventional (Mechanical) Type of Engine:

- Changing a set of governor’s fuel index limiter

- Adjusting the Mechanical Stop Screw and Two-position Stopper (TPS)

- Sealing the Mechanical Stop Screw by wire (to be confirmed at Class survey and PSC)

2. For the Electronically Controlled Type of Engine:

- Changing a setting of governor’s fuel index limiter (e.g., setting the fuel index limit in Chief Limiters)

Note: Since the electronically controlled type of engine is not physically sealed (unlike the mechanically driven type of engine), EPL compliance is controlled by checking the digital data recorded in the data logging program.

Principal Requirements of Engine Power Limitation (EPL)

- The available power is to be limited by locking the fuel index.

- EPL cannot be released without Master authorization.

- If EPL is released due to an emergency, relevant information is to be recorded in the Onboard Management Manual (OMM).

- The EPL system should be tamper-proof.

- The EPL system should be accompanied by an Onboard Management Manual (OMM).

###### Onboard Management Manual (OMM)

Each vessel subject to EPL as per EEXI should have an OMM that corresponds to the type of Main Engine and is developed by the engine maker.

The purpose of the OMM is to provide technical and operational conditions that the EPL system should satisfy to comply with EEXI requirements and use a power reserve for the ships.

The OMM describes the technical aspects of EPL, the sealing method (for conventional engines), methods for releasing the EPL, EPL survey details by Administration and Class, procedures for reporting on the release and reset of the EPL, and procedures for record keeping.

Note:   Master, Chief Officer, Chief Engineer, and 2nd Engineer should become familiar with the content of the OMM within the first week after embarkation.

##### Releasing and Resetting/Sealing the EPL

The EPL system can ONLY be overridden by the Master in an emergency situation, including:

- Securing the safety of the ship and life at sea

- Operating in adverse weather

- Operating in ice-infested waters

- Participation in search and rescue operations

- Avoidance of pirates (transit of HRA)

- Engine maintenance

Other special circumstances (see below)

Caution: The use of reserve power should not adversely affect the propeller or shaft-related systems.

Note: The Master shall have overriding authority when removal of EPL is required for safety purposes. The OOW shall inform the Master immediately if they believe the safety of the vessel is in danger.

On some vessels, the removal of the EPL may require time, and the procedure may impede immediate access to reserve power. Therefore, in special circumstances identified during Passage Plan Risk Assessment, the removal of EPL can be considered in advance by the Master. These circumstances may include:

- Navigating in restricted areas with strong following currents

- Navigating in congested waters

- Navigating on rivers with strong following currents (e.g., the Mississippi River between March and July each year)

In such cases, the Master may decide to remove the EPL to ensure emergency preparedness before the vessel proceeds on the passage (i.e., while preparing for departure from such ports). To do this, follow the specified procedure.

Procedure for removal of EPL in special circumstances

The Master has the overriding authority to remove the EPL and ensure the vessel’s emergency preparedness to meet safety requirements.

Follow below steps:

Assess the risks and decide whether reserve power may be necessary

Inform Office of the need to remove the EPL

Remove EPL as per procedure described in vessel’s OMM (e.g. before departure from berth)

Once the vessel departs form the critical navigation area restore the operation of the EPL as per procedure described in vessel’s OMM

¢¢	Completed	¢¢

###### Recordkeeping

When EPL was overridden but reserve power was not used:

- Record the removal of the EPL in the bridge AND Engine Room logbooks.

- Record the power used during the time the EPL was overridden in the Engine Room logbook.

- Record the details of the reset of the EPL in the Bridge and Engine Room logbooks.

When EPL was overridden and reserve power was used, record in OMM and Deck and Engine Room logbooks:

- Ship type

- IMO number

- Ship size in DWT and/or GRT

- Ship’s limited engine power and ship’s maximum unlimited engine power

- Position of the ship and time when reserve power was used

- Reason for using reserve power

- Weather conditions during the use of reserve power

- Supporting evidence for the weather conditions (e.g., weather reports, current charts)

- Records from the EPL system during the time reserve power was used

- Position and time when the EPL was reactivated

###### Reporting Requirements

In case reserve power is used, the vessel/operator (TSI) shall:

- Notify the Flag Administration/RO issuing the certification.

- Notify the competent authority at the port of destination.

- Provide the information/records listed in paragraph 2 above.

Resetting EPL:

- The EPL should be reset as soon as the emergency situation is over. The engine room team shall follow the guidance described in the relevant section of OMM for resetting the EPL.

- The reactivation or replacement of the EPL system should be confirmed (e.g., validation of mechanical sealing) with supporting evidence (e.g., engine power log, photo taken at the occasion of resetting the mechanical sealing) by the Administration or the RO at the earliest opportunity.

- The method of sealing or resetting the EPL is described in OMM.

###### Tamper-Proof Seals Management

Applies to conventional (non-electronic) types of engines.

Responsibilities of Chief Engineer:

- Ensure that at least 10 pieces of tamper-proof seals are available on board (in case of mechanical sealing).

- Ensure the tamper-proof seal is used one time; once in place, it cannot be removed without cutting the wire. Resealing requires a new seal.

Note: The suitable wire cutter must be located in close proximity to the seal.

Note: The Two-position Stopper (TPS) must NEVER be removed from the engine.

### 6.3.7 IHM and Asbestos Management - rev 0 issued 15.11.2024

##### Inventory of Hazardous Material

###### Introduction

The Inventory of Hazardous Material (IHM) is a system designed to control hazardous materials onboard ships, ensuring compliance with the Hong Kong Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships.

An IHM identifies, locates, and quantifies potentially hazardous materials onboard a vessel that pose risks to health, safety, or the environment.

The list of hazardous materials and their threshold values are outlined in MEPC 269(68) Appendix I and in EMSA Guidelines Annex B and C.

###### Preparation of IHM

The preparation of an IHM depends on several factors, including:

- Type and size of vessels

- Lead/Sister ships

- Class that will issue the Statement of Compliance (SoC). IHM EU is an open class regulation, allowing SoC issuance from any class of choice, not necessarily the ship's class.

- Available supporting documents. Documentation such as Green Passport (GP) notation, IHM as per Hong Kong Convention, or an asbestos-free certificate can reduce work scope and rates for IHM EU compliance.

Steps for IHM Preparation:

- Collection and Assessment of Drawings/Documents (done by expert company): Prior to boarding, the IHM company will study various plans and documents, including the General Arrangement Plan, Capacity Plan, Machinery Arrangement Plan, and others, to gather necessary information.

- Preparation of Visual Sampling Check Plan (VSCP): Based on the study, the IHM company will create a VSCP and a Location Diagram (LD) for the inspectors.

- Review of VSCP by Class: Inspectors will use the VSCP and LD to perform onboard inspections and sampling after coordinating with the ship's Master and officers.

- Onboard Attendance/Sampling (done by expert company): Inspectors will take photographs and samples from relevant parts of the vessel, ensuring minimal damage and safety. Intrinsically safe equipment will be used in areas with flammable gases.

- Lab Analysis and Reporting: Samples will be labeled and sent to a certified laboratory for analysis. The lab will report positive results for hazardous materials to the IHM company.

- Preparation of IHM Final Report (done by expert company): The IHM company will compile a final report and send it to the ship operator and/or Class or other Recognized Organization (RO) for review.

- Review of Final Report and Approval (done by Class): Class or the RO will review the report and issue a Statement of Compliance (SoC) or Certificate of Compliance (CoC) if satisfied.

- Onboard Verification and Issuance of SoC: Upon satisfactory review, a Statement of Compliance or Certificate of Compliance will be issued. If asbestos is found, the flag state must be contacted to decide the removal process, typically allowed up to 3 years, subject to national laws.

Notes and Cautions

The process must avoid damage to the ship’s structure or surfaces.

Intrinsically safe equipment must be used in areas with potential flammable gases.

The IHM preparation involves significant documentation and coordination with ship staff.

Compliance with national laws and IMO recommendations is crucial for handling hazardous materials like asbestos.

If asbestos is found the flag state needs to be contacted and further steps are to decided how and when to remove the asbestos. Usually there is a time period of 3 years recommended by IMO but some flag states have their national laws that shall be observed.

###### Responsibilities

Purchasing Department/Chief Engineer: Must clearly demand in the Purchase Order or Requisition Form that the supplier provide the Material Declaration (MD) and Supplier’s Declaration of Conformance (SDOC) along with the goods supplied.

Chief Engineer: Responsible for maintaining IHM records, either manually or using available software.

- Checking the number of equipment and components replaced onboard.

- Requesting and controlling the correct reception of SDoCs and MDs.

- Including MD data into the ship’s IHM.

- Updating the ship-specific IHM.

Regularly review the correct execution of IHM maintenance during general repair and maintenance management.

Technical Superintendent:

- Monitor the record-keeping of the ship’s IHM during onboard visits.

- Oversee the purchase department's follow-up with suppliers for MD and SDOC.

- Appoint a competent company every five years, if required, to advise, inspect, sample, test, and prepare a detailed report for the certifying authority.

###### Contents of IHM

Part I: Drawn up when the ship is being built or currently in service. Lists the location and quantity of hazardous materials found in the ship’s structure or fixed equipment/machinery onboard, with their locations and approximate quantities (Form ENG 32).

Part II: Drawn up prior to the ship proceeding for recycling. Lists the operationally generated waste present onboard.

Part III: Drawn up prior to the ship proceeding for recycling. Lists the hazardous materials contained in the remaining stores onboard.

Maintenance: Part I of the IHM must be properly maintained and updated throughout the ship's operational life. Prior to recycling, the IHM must include properly maintained and updated Part I, and incorporate Part II for operationally generated waste and Part III for stores.

###### Requirements for Maintenance of IHM

- Vessels contracted after July 2009 with IHM and GP notation, not maintained since delivery, may require inspection to meet current regulations.

- Vessels flying any EU flag with contracts signed before 31 December 2013 will need a supplementary inspection for additional substances PFOS and HBCDD.

- From 31 December 2020, vessels calling at any EU port or anchorage or flagged by an EU member state must have a verified IHM and certification per the EU Ship Recycling Regulation 1257/2013.

- Ship operators must ensure the IHM document onboard is kept up to date and changes to structure or equipment mentioned in Part I of the IHM are duly recorded. These records will be inspected annually by Class or the RO and may be checked during Port State Control inspections.

Note: Examples of changes to be recorded include:

- Replacement of hazardous radioactive type smoke detectors with non-hazardous photoelectric type.

- Replacement of fixed installation GMDSS battery banks with different types of batteries.

- Replacement of insulation material on an accommodation deck after a minor fire.

###### Piracy and Hijacking –Gulf of Aden & West Africa

Recent political, economic and technological developments gave birth to new set of security threats. Piracy activity developed in new areas around the world and changed its objectives and modus operandi. 
The new objectives of pirate attacks, depending on the trading area, are various:

- Hijacking vessels and crew:

- For theft of personal and company property

- To exchange for ransom

- For cargo theft or siphoning

- To use for terrorist activity purpose

The joint war committee (JWC) have identified piracy, terrorism and related perils high risk areas and published in their circular letters. This is a live document and updated as required.

Adopt additional security measures in below piracy high risk areas, in addition to SSP requirements, while at sea and in port:

- Indian Ocean / Arabian Sea / Gulf of Aden / Gulf of Oman / Southern Red Sea JWLA/022 Circular

- West Coast of Africa

- Post extra lookouts

- Use the international recommended transit corridor (IRTC)

- Discuss with your marine superintendent regarding use of group transit or naval convoys, when available

- Ensure that ship is ‘sufficiently and effectively manned’

- Follow the suggestions from the latest edition of ‘Best Management Practices’, on how to secure the ship and prevent pirates from boarding

Caution: Do not place crew at risk when following any of the practices.

- Rig sufficient deterrent to discourage pirates from boarding

- Prepare risk assessment during each transit through any HRA considering:

- Existing threats

- Freeboard of ship

- Speed of ship

- Sea state

- Use of armed guards

- Cargo on board

Note:	We recommend leaving AIS transmitting across the entire High Risk Area/VRA as set out in BMP5. Restrict AIS transmission to ship’s identity, position, course, speed, navigational status and safety-related information. The decision on AIS policy remains at the discretion of the master; however, if switched off during transit, activate immediately at the time of an attack.

###### Violent Acts and Robbery

####### General advice

Attacks may range from piracy attacks to theft of cargo to pilferage, each requiring a different response. Read these instructions in consultation with your vessels SSP.

####### Prior entering a high risk area:

- Have a well-practiced anti-attack plan, covering measures for early detection of a possible attack, non-aggressive crew responses when an attack is under way, radio and alarm procedures, and reports to be made after a successful or attempted attack.

- Inform crewmembers of the anti-attack plan and hold training exercises to ensure that they are fully briefed on the actions to take in the event of an attack.

- Identify and establish controlled secure areas, difficult for attackers to penetrate, as a sanctuary for the crew. If large numbers of armed robbers succeed in boarding the ship, it may be essential for crewmembers to retreat to a secure area or areas. Depending upon the extent to which areas can be effectively sealed off, the secure area may be established in the accommodation, or in more restricted parts around the Bridge and inside the Engine Room. Provision shall always be made for escape during fire or another emergency.

- Be discreet during ship/shore radio transmissions.

- Establish signals to warn crew of impending attack and “all clear”

- Prepare emergency messages ready for immediate transmission, if required.

- Brief crew on non-aggressive response in the event of boarding taking place.

- Be prepared to hand over valuables to minimize risk of violence and reprisals.

- Drill personnel on security measures and responses.

- Maintain a vigilant lookout both visually and by radar.

- Pay particular attention to small craft approaching.

- Be aware that decoy craft may draw attention from main attack.

- Consistent with safety, keep all accommodation doors closed and locked.

- Keep all stores and deck lockers locked and Engine Room skylights closed.

- Keep portholes and windows closed and deadlights dogged shut.

- Provide additional radio equipped deck patrols as required.

- Instruct patrols to remain in shadow areas.

- Patrols should be equipped with sharp knives/axes to cut grappling lines.

- Where possible, route vessel away from known attack areas.

- Ensure vessel has room to maneuver – avoid bottlenecks.

- Rig fire hoses at stern and elsewhere as required.

- Keep cable washer valves open.

- Keep water on deck.

- Keep deck areas, particularly the poop, well illuminated, consistent with safe navigation.

- Use signal projectors / searchlights to probe for suspect craft using radar guidance where possible.

####### When operating in a high-risk area:

- With the agreement of the CSO, adjust routing away from danger areas, if possible, and employ measures such as slow steaming or longer routing to delay anchoring when arriving at anchorage during darkness in high-risk areas. When trading along coasts known for pirate attacks, it is recommended to stay well away from shore to avoid proceeding between the main land and islands, to sail at full speed and to keep as many lookouts as can be spared.

- When visiting a port where pirates are known to attack anchored ships, try to time the ship's arrival so as to coincide with daylight. If a long waiting time before berthing is anticipated, consider "making your number" so as to establish berth priority and then retreating into safer deep waters. Charterers should be aware of these problems and be willing to cooperate.

- All information concerning sailing routes, schedules and the nature of the cargo carried shall be treated as confidential.

- Where a ship is on liner service, arrivals and departures shall be scheduled so as to minimize the risk of an attack. Liner companies often dispatch a ship with orders to make best speed to the next port. It is better to sail slow or stop during the passage and arrive when certain that a berth is vacant.

- Limit, monitor and control access to ship when in port and at anchor, search ship before leaving ports and restrict information on the nature and location of cargoes onboard.

- Be vigilant - most attacks will be deterred if the robbers are aware that they have been observed and that the crew has been alerted and is prepared to resist attempts to board.

- Ensure that crewmembers are seen to be constantly moving around the ship, making random rather than predictable patrols.

- Maintain a 24-hour visual and security watch - including short-range radar surveillance of the waters around the ship. Keep a special lookout for small boats and fishing boats which are difficult to observe on radar.

- In piracy "hotspots", discourage the crew from trading with locals using small craft which may approach the ship.

- Pay attention to the activities of such small craft that show signs of approaching the ship and be aware of the possibility of a decoy craft deliberately acting suspiciously, being used to draw attention from the main attack (refer to “anti-small craft attack plan”).

- Strengthen night watches - especially around the stern of the vessel and particularly between the hours of 18:00 – 06:00 when most attacks occur, with continuous patrols linked by handheld radios to the bridge. If possible, allocate an additional Officer to assist the normal bridge watch-keepers at night, to provide a dedicated radar and visual watch for small craft which might attempt to maneuver alongside and allow the watch-keepers to concentrate on normal navigation duties.

- Seal off means of access to the ship - fit rat guards to mooring lines, fit hawse pipe plates, lock doors etc.

- While taking due account of the need for escape in the event of fire or other emergency, so far as possible, seal off all means of access to the accommodation area and lock windows and doors. Blocking access between the aft deck and the crew quarters is particularly important. All doors to Bridge, Engine Room, Steering Gear, Storerooms, Deck Lockers, etc. and Engine Room skylights must be kept closed.

- Establish radio contact - and agree emergency signals specifically for pirate attacks with the crew, the CSO, the PFSO and other shore authorities.

- Use available lighting - deck and over-side lights, particularly at the bow and stern, in order to illuminate the deck and the waters beyond and to dazzle potential borders. Searchlights shall be available on the bridge wings and flashlights shall be carried by the security patrols to identify suspicious craft. Such additional lighting shall not however be so bright as to obscure navigation lights or interfere with the safe navigation of other vessels.

- Keep water hoses and other equipment - which may be used to repel potential borders - readily available. Keep a constant pressure of water in the hoses. In danger areas keep the deck wash pump in operation at all times - spray water over the rear deck where it is easiest for the attackers to board.

- Reduce opportunities for theft - remove all portable equipment from the deck; maintain a constant radio watch with shore or naval authorities in danger areas and on all distress and safety frequencies.

- Report suspicious movements to the RCC for the area.

####### Additional Measures when at anchor or stand-by:

  - Increase external illumination to maximum levels.

  - Keep vessel sides illuminated in addition to forecastle and poop areas.

  - Keep cable washers on at all times and fit hawse pipe plates.

  - Keep anchors full stored and not slacked if possible.

  - Consider increasing deck patrols if required.

  - Accommodation and pilot ladders to be rigged to conduct ship’s business then stowed immediately after use.

  - Ensure no overside ropes or lines are in place.

  - Keep fire wires, where deployed, well-greased.

  - Control the number of people allowed access onboard and record the names of those who are admitted in the gangway log. o Do not allow local traders onboard. CCTVs may also used to record movements in and around the main access to the ship. o Control decks regularly and, in areas of particular danger, ensure a good lookout at all times by using additional watches.

  - Deck watchmen should make their rounds at irregular intervals to avoid thieves timing a boarding in between rounds.

  - Crew members on watch should be in radio contact with the bridge, checking in at regular intervals.

####### Reporting

In any such instances the master should immediately inform the company, the P&I insurer and local correspondent and request assistance.

If the vessel is in port or at anchor, also inform the competent local authority such as the Port Facility Security Officer (PFSO) and call for help.

####### Pirates / Robbers Detected - Prior to Boarding the Vessel

Immediately contact with other vessels in the vicinity, authorities ashore and the Piracy Reporting Centre (PRC) by sending a “Piracy/armed robbery attack” message. The PRC is based in Kuala Lumpur and can be contacted on a 24-hour basis.

IMB Piracy Reporting Centre

Tel: +60 3 2078 5763 / +60 3 2031 0287 / + 60 3 2031 3106

24 Hrs ANTI PIRACY HELPLINE:         +603 2031 0014 (24h)

/

Send a written report named Piracy and Maritime Violence Incidence

####### Pirates / Robbers - Boarded

When pirates have boarded the vessel and if they order the vessel to maintain radio silence, non-compliance can result in physical violence or even death. Comply with any such order, particularly as the pirates may carry radio/satellite detection equipment. After the attack, the master should report the attack to the closest RCC, CSO, Local PSC.

###### Hostage Situation

In case taken hostage act as follows:

Cooperate fully

Remain calm

Do not try to resist armed terrorists

Do not attempt to be a negotiator

Avoid physical resistance

Work to improve your position

Be cautious of attempting heroics – don’t act foolishly

Look for a protected place where you could dive or roll if either authorities or offenders attempt to assault your location with force

Keep your cool: attempt to relax by thinking about pleasant scenes or memories, or the plots of books or movies

Keep a low profile: avoid the appearance of observing crimes that the hostage takers commit, look down or away from them and avoid interfering with their discussions and activities

Do not make threats against the hostage takers or give any indication that you would testify against them - if offenders are attempting to conceal their identities, make no indication that you recognize them

Be reluctant to give up your identification or clothes: loss of these things is demoralizing. Offenders will use them for bargaining. Be especially resistant to exchanging clothes with an offender. This could put you in much greater danger in case of an assault

Try to drink water and eat even if you are not hungry: it is important to maintain strength

Be conscious of your body language, as well as your speech. Do not say or do anything to arouse the hostility or suspicions of your captors. Act neutral and be a good listener if your captors want to talk. Be cautious about making suggestions to your captors, as you may be held responsible if something goes wrong

Think of persuasive reasons the hostage takers should keep you and the other hostages alive and not harm you. Encourage them to let authorities know of your whereabouts and condition. Suggest possible ways where you or others may benefit your captors in negotiations that would free you.

If you, as a hostage, end up serving as negotiator between offender and authorities, messages between the two groups should be conveyed accurately

If there is an assault to rescue and shots fired, drop quickly to the floor and seek cover. Keep your hands on your head. When appropriate, identify yourself. Do not resist being apprehended until positive identification is made

In the event of a sexual attack by a hostage taker, the hostage should offer verbal resistance.

Even though you must appear disinterested while being held hostage, observe all that you can.

###### In the event or in anticipation of military action

- Do not react to strangely dressed newcomers.

- Do not attract attention to any unusual activity.

- If shooting or the loud command “GET DOWN” is heard, immediately lie face down, cover ears, close eyes, and slightly open mouth. Do not move until an “ALL CLEAR’’ is given.

- If the loud command “STAND STILL” is heard, then freeze immediately.

- Do not shelter or hide terrorists.

- Do not take photographs of the military assault force.

Following the incident, the master and his crew should avoid talking to the press and other media persons about the methods used to resolve the incidents.

##### Evidence to Collect

If an attack takes place, collect the following evidence:

- Date, vessel’s time and UTC (Co-ordinated Universal Time) the attack occurred

- The vessel’s position/location at the time of the attack

- Prevailing weather and visibility at the time of the attack (keep any weather records)

- Draught and freeboard of the vessel at time of the attack

- If underway, the course and speed of the vessel

- Statements from eyewitnesses

- Other observations made by crew or persons prior the incident.



### 7.1.2 Ship Specific Counter Piracy Measures - rev 0 issued 26.11.2024

##### Vessel Hardening

###### Introduction

With ever increasing piracy threat from Gulf of Aden, Red Sea, Arabian Sea, West Africa it has become important to fortify the vessels for passive purpose (deterrence) and for active purpose (defense).

Each vessel has its own vulnerabilities, which pirates will aim to exploit in the event of an attack, including areas of low freeboard and areas where grapples, ladders and other tools attached to allow access.

Pirates typically board vessels underway using long lightweight hooked ladders; grappling hooks with rope attached and long hooked poles with a climbing rope attached.

Use physical barriers to make it as difficult as possible to gain access to vessels by increasing the height. Physical barriers will bar the pirates from boarding the vessel, gaining access to the vital areas within the vessel such as the bridge, engine room, and crew quarters.

If their access is barred and their attempts to control the ship hampered, then many pirates will simply abandon their attempt.

###### Ship Specific Vessel Hardening Measures

Well-prepared vessels that implement the BMP recommended measures to deter a piracy attack, managed to repel such attacks.

Take below measures in consideration including ships specific hardening plans when prepare your vessel for HRA (High Risk Area) / VRA (Voluntary Reporting Area) transits.

If pirates assess a vessel as difficult to board, they will concentrate on finding easier targets.

All voyages in HRA and VRA require thorough advanced planning using all available information. The maritime threats are dynamic, and it is therefore essential that vessel’s Master revert with a detailed threat and risk assessment completed for each voyage and activity within the region.

CSO will review and if require will amend/add any additional information.

Each vessel must prepare a vessel specific plan to deal with HRA and VRA transit preparedness and pirate attack measures.

The plan must:

Be compiled onboard each vessel

Consider the ship’s design and general arrangement

Define an alarm for pirate attack situation and make sure that all crew is aware of its significance (for example - three short blasts by GA and ship’s whistle, every 20 seconds for 3 minutes)

Note:	Except the bridge team, the rest of the crew must proceed to the citadel. 
If boarded by pirates, the bridge team must join the other crewmembers in citadel and secure the location

Define the bridge team composition during a pirate attack

Identify access points inside accommodation and if required fabricate on board means to secure such accesses. Examples:

- Fitting bars to large windows

- Developing securing means where not fitted (on doors etc.)

- Secure E/R skylights doors, forecastle store and S/G room’s access hatches to deck with wires or chain-blocks internally, to prevent opening from outside

- Deploy the razor wire around the identified access risk areas.
 Make sure to secure the wire using strong gear (seizing wire) to resist eventual stress caused by hooks, etc.

- Deploy double layer chain link fence around bridge and bridge wings area for protection against RPG rounds

Install blast resistant film on bridge windows

Install fire hoses in fixed positions and have the firefighting system ready to be operated from remote controls

Remove all power tools from easily accessible locations

Review the company’s manning requirements. Consider disembarking of non-essential crew.

Assign crewmembers who must bring provisions and water to the citadel to cover a fixed period of time (maximum 1 day);

Make sure that contact details to all parties as per BMP 5 and company emergency manual are available on the bridge and in citadel

In conjunction with the office decide the route the vessel will follow when transiting VRA

Define the location for the citadel and reinforce that access to delay, as much as possible, the unauthorized access

Caution! Do not affect the integrity of fire doors.

Maintain the reinforcement arrangements inconspicuous to persons not familiar with the ship’s layout (example – hide reinforced doors by the normal doors, etc.)

Consider disabling the CO2 release system while the E/R area is used as citadel refuge location

If pirates get access to ship, assign one person to isolate the fire/foam lines on deck from the main isolation valves (i.e. in the Foam Room), before he will proceed to the citadel, so in case of fire in E/R which may be used as citadel, to have means to fight it

Identify ventilation means needed for the citadel

If boarded by pirates stop the ship and switch controls to E/R

Identify means of interrupting the power to accommodation and deck areas, or any power plug that may be used that is not in citadel area

Identify means to cut off lighting power in accommodation area

Consider controlled black-out procedure if necessary, to create confusion and difficult orientation in areas outside citadel (if this goal can be achieved in another way, then identify the procedure)

###### Hardening Measures

####### Passive Measures

Razor Wires

Deploy Razor wire along vessel’s side, as a first line of countermeasure, to prevent unauthorized access to the vessel. Razor wire creates an effective barrier but only when it is carefully deployed. The barbs on the wire have a piercing and gripping action.

When deploying razor wire use personal safety and protective measures. Use latest BMP information. Below are few of measures described at BMP

- Wire fence should be deployed equipped with two rows of razor wire

- Razor wire to all external accommodation ladders should be deployed

- Wire fence should be deployed equipped with two rows of razor wire

- Wire fence should be deployed equipped with two rows of razor wire at poop Deck

Dummies

- Use dummies in areas where vision from bridge is reduced.

- Bridge Deck should be hardened by wire fence

Blockade of ladders

- Block ladders around the accommodation using razor wires and obstructions.

Citadel

- Define the location for the citadel, must be ready and secured.

- Reinforce access in order to deny the unauthorized access, as much as possible.

Lighting

- Weather deck lighting around the accommodation block and rear facing lighting on the poop deck to demonstrate awareness.

- If fitted, searchlights ready for immediate use.

- Once you identify attackers or an attack commences, switch on over side lighting. This will dazzle the attackers and help the ship’s crew to see them.

- At night, exhibit only navigation lights.

- Do not switch off navigation lights at night. This contravenes international regulations.

Note:	The risk of collision is higher than of being attacked.

- At anchor, leave deck lights on, as well-lit ships are less vulnerable to attack.

- The ability to turn off all internal accommodation lights to deter pirates from entering or disorientate those who may already have entered.

Deny the Use of Ship’s Tools and Equipment

- Secure ship’s tools or equipment that pirates may use to gain entry to the ship.

- Store tools and equipment that may be of use to attackers in a secure location.

- Quick closing fuel valves should be isolated

- Emergency engine trip should also be isolated

####### Active Measures

Fire Hoses

- Deploy fire hoses around the upper deck. Keep them pressurized on approach of pirates.

Increased Lookout

- Use heightened lookouts in high-risk areas. Lookouts should use night vision binoculars, where necessary.

Training of crewmembers

- Full drill with an attack simulated including all crewmembers, including master

- Practice evasive measures. The master and officers should practice maneuvering the ship to ensure familiarity with the ship’s handling characteristics. The master should also practice avoidance maneuvers while maintaining the best possible speed.

Note:	Experience has shown that such action can defeat even a lengthy and determined attack as creation of hydrostatic pressure can have a better defensive impact than speed.

Caution! Practice avoidance maneuvers only when it is safe to do so.

- Practice moving to citadel. Test communication.

- Lock down procedure – entry and exit procedure

###### Hardening Materials

####### Maintenance and Inventory

Ensuring the presence and accuracy of a comprehensive inventory list of all hardening materials, specific to the ship's VHP (Vessel Hardening Plan), is of utmost importance.

This inventory list should always be readily available on board and kept up to date. It is crucial to have all the necessary hardening materials accessible before entering any high-risk area.

Conducting regular physical checks of all hardening materials is essential, ideally on a monthly basis or as stipulated in the Ship Security Plan (SSP) or VHP.

This practice guarantees that the materials are in proper working condition and readily deployable when needed.

To maintain an adequate supply of hardening materials, it is important to ensure that the required quantities are available at all times.

Caution! In case of any shortages, promptly notify your Purchasing Officer and request the necessary quantities in advance, as per the inventory list, before entering a high-risk area.

Carry out detailed inspection and maintenance records for all security materials and equipment. These records provide a valuable reference for tracking the condition and upkeep of the materials, ensuring their effectiveness and compliance with security standards.

### 7.1.3 Drones - Security Awareness - rev 0 issued 26.11.2024

##### Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Maritime Industry

###### Introduction

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are aircraft designed for flight without an onboard crew. They can be operated remotely or navigate autonomously using onboard computers.

###### Responsibilities

Master: Implement monitoring and preventive actions against drone attacks.

Company: Provide the master with security information if drone attacks are a threat in the trading area.

###### UAVs in Maritime Transport

In the marine environment, drones are used for:

- Port security surveillance

- Supply delivery to vessels

- Vessel inspection of topside, external structures, and internal tank inspections

If such drone operations are planned, the company will provide the necessary information in advance.

###### UAVs Malicious Usage

UAVs can travel long distances and carry cargo, making them potential tools for terrorist attacks on commercial vessels. Recently, the UKMTO has reported drone attacks.

Malevolent uses of drones include:

- Terror control

- Bomb attacks

- Malicious communication

- Cybersecurity attacks

- Illegal smuggling

- Hacking

- Privacy breaches

Drones can carry harmful chemicals or explosives, deliver items discreetly, and may crash, causing damage or casualties. Masters and crew must remain vigilant, especially in regions of conflict or political tension.

Caution: Non-advertised UAV approaches should be considered security threats.

###### Counter-Drone Vessel Protection

In areas where drone attacks are reported, countermeasures should be implemented.

UAV Detection: Post lookouts to detect UAVs and inform the duty officer.

Counter-Drone Crew Protection:

- Raise the alarm, prepare firefighting equipment, and alert the emergency squad to mitigate fires caused by drone attacks.

- Inform UKMTO / Naval Forces in the area, if available

- Shelter non-essential personnel in safe areas.

- Consider evacuation if at berth, as directed by local authorities, or abandon ship if at sea in life-threatening situations.

Crew Awareness of Drone Use: Masters and crew must be aware of local regulations concerning the use of private drones in ports or territorial waters. These regulations vary by country, and non-compliance can lead to criminal prosecution.

###### Forms / Records

- Ship Security Plan

If you rescue refugees be reminded that the P&I Insurance Cover is involved, therefore contact immediately:

- the company CSO, DPA

- the P&I insurer or their local correspondent.

Any guidance provided below does not supersede any regulatory requirements including SOLAS & ISPS Code.

If refugees are picked up at sea, bear in mind that they may have been at sea for several weeks and may be suffering from exposure, hunger, dehydration, seasickness and fatigue.

The UNHCR Guidelines for the Disembarkation of Refugees provide a scheme for the reimbursement of certain costs involved in landing refugees. This scheme may not cover a deviation for the purposes of landing the refugees. Therefore, the master must consult the company, provided time allows, if he/she is considering deviating the vessel.

Guidance is available in publication ‘Large Scale Rescue Operations at Sea’.

###### Roles And responsibilities

CSO / DPA should ensure that security policies include large scale rescue operations and that their crews are adequately trained to deal with such incidents, not only with regards to compliance but in practical terms.

Masters in overall command and control of the rescue operation and coordinate with relevant authorities, agencies, and other personnel involved in the operation.

###### Prior Preparations

####### Equipment

Due to the potential numbers of rescues involved, provisions, supplies and equipment may be necessary for dealing with and conducting a Large-scale rescue operation as follow:

Provisions: Food and drinking water

Tarpaulins to provide shelter

Sanitary/Medical: First aids and medical supplies, chlorine-based cleaning products, anti-bacterial sanitizers, respiratory and eye protections, waste bags, gloves (both cotton/fabric and latex or nitrile)

Safety: working clothes, lifejackets and life rings

Security: High visibility vests, loud hailer

####### Conducting the Rescue

Review of circumstances might include following

- The immediacy of the threat to life of the persons on the vessel or craft

- The risks posed to ship, crew9 and those to be rescued during a large-scale rescue operation

- The preparedness of the ship for embarkation

- The proximity of Search and Rescue (SAR) services.

Control of embarking persons is essential during rescue.

Keep the master informed of the full situation

Bridge and deck crisis management team should be predetermined so that the information can be recorded and reported as required

Use following checklist to assist and document with the recovery of the persons:

- Recovery Persons from the Water Plan

- EMER 16 Man Overboard-recovery of persons from the water-Search & rescue

- EMER 17 Medical Emergency - Serious illness or injury

- EMER 18 Death

###### Action to take

When taking refugees on board the vessel shall take the following action:

Report to the company and the P&I insurer that refugees are on board so that the company security officer (CSO) can inform the appropriate authorities such as the port facility security officer (PFSO), at the next port of call

Once decided to land the refugees, inform the company’s agent and the correspondent in the landing port

Prepare accommodation on board for the refugees, including blankets and beds

Prepare provisions for the refugees

Seek medical advice from ashore if necessary.

####### Reception and refugees’ management

Rescued-persons management

Recording of numbers, gender, age and general health and consider the following:

Record Priority medical attention required for rescued-personnel

Photograph all persons

Note: Remember to ask permission for photographing children. This will be a useful evidence trail should a rescued-person ever make allegations after disembarkation as to their treatment or there be issues with who was on the vessel or not.

Use form in Appendix C of IMS 19.5a Large scale rescue operations at sea (Latest edition)

Searching of Personnel and Baggage / Belongings

Personnel conducting the personal searches should remember the following:

Be least intrusive manner.

Maintain dignity.

Search basis Male to Male, Female to Female if possible.

Note: In case no female in crew, appoint a person from the rescued persons to carry the search.

- Wear gloves

- Have a witness.

- Give rescued-person guidelines for stay on board

- Ask permission, explain that you are about to carry out a search and where you are about to touch the person.

- Record the details, name, date /time, search person, witness (Free form)

Belongings Record and Storage

- Search all baggage.

- Ask for any belongings and documents that they are carrying.

- Take an inventory of any belongings.

- Place all in a plastic bag and add a copy of the inventory.

Designated to Accommodation Area and Moved by a Guide

- Ensure every group when moving around the vessel are escorted by at least 2 crew members.

- Always keep them in sight.

- Divide rescued persons into manageable group sizes that suit the accommodation.

- Record numbers in each cabin / accommodation area this will help with security checks and monitoring.

- Daily check of the embarked rescued personnel

- Keep a copy of accommodation plans and records on the bridge.

Accommodation

- Remove from the accommodation areas anything that could be used as a weapon or to cause damage to the vessel, cargo or crew. If lockers are within the accommodation area, ensure that they are emptied of contents then secured.

- Check that safety lockers are not tampered with and that adequate firefighting and medical equipment is accessible.

- Accommodation records should be kept (Free form).

Victualing

- Arrange meal times to divide rescued-persons into manageable group sizes

- Water should be allocated within the accommodation areas to limit movement around the ship out of meal timings.

Handling and storage of dead bodies

- If using refrigerated areas to store bodies, ensure it is separate from food storage.

- Crew to be briefed before rescue operations to deal with the recovery and storage of recovered persons that do not survive.

- The dead may include elderly, small children, infants.

- Discuss what they are likely going to see and how they are going to feel.

- Recognise the positive value of the task and emphasise that it should be done step by step and to pace themselves over the duration of the task.

- Remember to be always respectful and avoid potential conflict.

- Explain to the rescued group what is happening to the bodies as family members will be very distressed and this will need to be managed.

Masters Interviews / Statement of Facts

Interview a few of the rescued persons to record information and pass onto the authorities.

Ensure that interviews are witnessed and is an informal and calm information gathering exercise, use IMS form SECURITY 5 - Questionnaire for Stowaways

###### Liaison And Communications

Internal Liaison

Appointed liaison officer/Chief Officer

Is the liaison between the rescued group and the ship’s crew. This will allow the Master to manage his ship and give the crew and rescued group a single point of contact.

Appointed rescued person(s) liaison

If there is a language barrier you will need assistance with communication to the rescued group, try to locate someone within the group look to for leadership, group senior /leader.

Information and briefings / good lines of communication

Keeping crew and rescued persons informed with what is happening.

Note: It is important to reduce stress and anxiety amongst the rescued group so that potential problems and control issues do not arise.

Sensitive ships business should not be communicated to the rescued group and only “need to know” information passed to them.

Carry on regular reporting and briefing between master and Appointed liaison officer.

Note: To understand what is happening, how the rescue group are doing and what is being asked etc. This should be done in isolation from the rescue group. Liaison officer should be honest, open and frank about the situation. Support should be given to the liaison officer as this can be a very stressful task even if they are appropriately trained.

For communication between the crew and the rescued-personnel use of loud Hailers, PA System

- Use visual signs in various languages to aid in the conduct of the rescue, and in managing and administrating the rescued personnel. (Print posters from Appendix B of IMS 19.5a Large scale rescue operations at sea (Latest edition)

External liaison

Company as per Vessel Emergency Manual.

Use contacts of Search and Rescue Contacts (SAR) from official publications and/or SOPEP – SMPEP Updated List of National Contact Points.

Record of all communication expenses, e.g. Charges for each  message received or transmitted via a radio station

Copy of the deck logbook and other relevant logs, including engine room log.

##### Handling Large Crowds

###### Introduction

This procedure guides masters and crewmembers when they rescue and deal with large number of survivors encountered at sea, until their safe disembarkation.

Recent events showed that large numbers of immigrants have been rescued at sea from unseaworthy ships / boats. In some cases crowds as large as 350 people or more have been rescued in one mission.

The sheer number of persons in need of assistance can be overwhelming and crewmembers need to understand the challenges that they may face in such situations.

The crewmembers must be aware of several possible hazards associated with handling large crowds to better deal with this kind of emergency.

###### Responsibilities

Master & crew

Treat embarked persons in distress at sea with humanity, within the capabilities and limitations of the ship.

###### Communication Hazards

Unable to

Get messages across to the crowd

Understand the type of assistance required by persons in need

Communicate safety related issues and explain desired safety behavior to the crowd.

  - Possible mitigating actions

Look for persons that are able to communicate in English language and translate to the rest of the crowd

Determine which persons are seen as group leaders (usually elder persons are respected in most countries) and establish good communication with them. Use them to transmit and disseminate the information you need

Instruct crew to have a friendly attitude, be patient and smile when interfering with the crowd

Instruct crew to avoid shouting or using aggressive body language

Assign personnel to attend to the crowd. Restrict other crewmembers interference with the crowd

###### Health Hazards

##### Stowaways

When a vessel calls at ports with high risk for stowaways the following precautions need to take place.

###### Action to Take

Prior to arrival

- Ensure that all permanent deck lighting is fully operational.

- Ensure that all areas not essential for the loading/discharging of cargo shall be carefully secured.

At Anchor

- All means of access should be secured especially the hawse pipes of the anchor chains.

- Gangway ladders shall be raised when not in use.

- A proper watch shall be kept at all times.

- Security lighting shall be used if applicable/available. Don’t forget that, most of the times, a well lit ship works as a prevention factor.

- Adjacent sea area shall be properly and adequately monitored.

In Port

- Information regarding next destination port should be restricted to as few personnel as possible and necessary especially if this is to countries favoured to stowaways, such as Canada, USA.

- A gangway watch must always be maintained. Don’t forget that crew personnel with good communication and an impression of an efficient and high-profile regime most of the times works as a prevention factor.

- Access to accommodation must always be restricted. Only essential access shall remain open and unlocked and regular checks shall be made.

- Ensure that all areas not essential for the loading/discharging of cargo shall be carefully secured and locked and regular checks shall be made.

- Adjacent sea area shall be properly and adequately monitored.

Pre-sailing actions

- Conduct a thorough and extensive search.

- According to the previous paragraph, divide the ship in zones and begin search simultaneously and systematically. After the completion of the search of each zone report it to the OOW in order to tick the relevant box in the check list.

- Upon completion of the check list make an entry in the logbook by recording, time date, names of the persons who have conducted the search.

  - If stowaways are discovered on board, contact the company CSO, the P&I insurer or their local correspondent. If vessel still at port delay departure if this is possible and coordinate with local authorities to disembark all stowaways. When stowaways are discovered on board the vessel at sea, the master should refer to the procedure contained in the ship security plan and below.

Lock the discovered stowaway in a cabin. The stowaway should not be allowed to roam freely about the vessel

If more than one stowaway is found, if possible accommodate them separately

The place where the stowaway was found should be:

- Searched for further stowaways and any documents left behind

- photographed or video taken

- Thoroughly searched for drugs, as stowaways can be used as drug couriers.

Note:		If drugs are found, leave the place untouched and sealed off.

Take photographs or video of the location where the drugs were found

Search the stowaway for identity papers. If found, confiscate the documents as stowaways often try to hide their identity or destroy their identity papers

Search the stowaway thoroughly for drugs.

Note:	If drugs are found on the stowaway, take photographs and/or video and make a note of the circumstances in which the drugs were found

Question the stowaway in detail as to when and where the boarding took place

Note:	For interrogation purposes use the detailed Stowaway Questionnaire found in the SSP

Question more than one stowaway individually as to:

- Whether they knew each other prior to boarding

- How they came on board

Question the stowaway as to why he/she has stowed away and the circumstances under which his voluntary return may be possible

If the stowaway agrees to return voluntarily it should be made clear that unless he/she co-operates repatriation may be impossible

The person questioning the stowaway, preferably the Master, should explain that if economic reasons are behind stowing away, no other country will accept them and repatriation will be inevitable

Immediately notify the company and the P&I insurer enabling the CSO to inform the appropriate authorities at the next port of call, such as the PSSO – for reporting please refer to Annex 8, Stowaway Questionnaire

Notify the correspondent and the vessel’s agents in the next port of call or the port of embarkation, so that they can prepare for identification and repatriation of the stowaway.

Note:	Generally, repatriation cannot be carried out if advance notice of the stowaway has not been provided

If it is impossible to communicate with the stowaway, an interpreter should be engaged ashore in order to gain an initial impression and obtain some basic information about the stowaway

Treat the stowaway humanely and do not threaten or expose to any violence whatsoever as this will incur severe criminal penalties.

Take video evidence of the treatment of the stowaway during the course of the voyage.

###### Evidence to collect

Date, vessel’s time, UTC (Co-ordinated Universal Time) and port where stowaway came on board

Date, vessel’s time, UTC (Co-ordinated Universal Time) and location the stowaway was discovered on the vessel

Place/location where the stowaway hid

Key Points:

- Some IT and OT systems have remote accessibility for monitoring, maintenance, and security.

- Systems requiring third-party access include bridge and engine room computers, stability support systems, hull stress monitoring, navigational systems, and cargo management systems.

- Risk assessments must consider third-party and remote access, with appropriate risk mitigation measures established and periodically reviewed by the IT Support team.

###### Systems and Network Protection

The ship uses three separate VLANs for corporate, crew, and voice networks, all behind a WatchGuard Firewall. Crew internet access is independent of the ship's business network to prevent virus infections from downloads.

- CBS Protection: The CBS is protected by ESET Endpoint Antivirus, with updates managed by the ESET Remote Administrator Server installed on the ZWANA machine.

###### Data protection

All onboard computers are protected by antivirus solutions and firewall systems. To avoid data loss due to malware or corruption, the following backup procedures are implemented:

- IT Department: Sets up automatic data backups for shipboard computers.

- All Staff: Responsible for regular backups of important files to specified backup locations.

- Master: Performs weekly backups of specified folders to an external hard drive as a secondary backup measure.

Vessel’s Backup Guidelines:

- Store business-related files in the network share drive “Y:\”

- Regularly copy locally stored documents to the network share drive “T:\”

- Copy important documents/files to a network folder labeled “backup”

- Automated full server backups are scheduled daily at 21:00.

- Automated full master computer backups are scheduled every Sunday at 00:00.

- Obsolete or broken storage devices must be destroyed before disposal.

###### Physical and Removable Media Controls

Transferring data from uncontrolled to controlled systems poses a significant malware risk. Removable media can bypass defenses and attack systems not connected to the internet.

Caution: Avoid using media devices to transfer information between uncontrolled and controlled systems when possible.

When unavoidable, follow these steps:

- Check removable media for malware before use.

- Scan removable media on a computer not connected to the ship’s controlled networks.

- If scanning onboard is not possible, ensure the media is scanned and documented before boarding.

Notify ports and terminals about the requirement to scan removable media before uploading files onto the ship’s system. This scanning should cover:

- Cargo files and loading plans (e.g., container ship BAPLIE files)

- National, customs, and port authority forms

- Bunkering and lubrication oil forms

- Ship’s stores and provisions lists

- Engineering maintenance files

Note: This list is illustrative and not exhaustive.

##### Detection safeguards

###### Monitoring of normal operation

Ensure that terms and conditions of the time charter are not contrary to owners’/head charterer’s instructions. Contact the office when required.

Deliver and redeliver the vessel at the time and condition as per the terms and conditions stated in the CP. Delivery and redelivery notices must be copied to the office, stating date, time (LT/UTC), bunker ROB, and status of holds. Include a list of outstanding stevedore or other damages at the time of redelivery.

Note: Use the form DRY 09 - Re-Delivery Notice.

###### Tendering Notice of Readiness

Tender the notice of readiness strictly as per the relevant clause of the governing charter party and/or instructions.

Copy all notices sent under voyage charter parties or sub-time charters (to agents, charterers, shippers, receivers, etc.) to the office.

If there is any concern about the validity of a notice of readiness already tendered, re-tender the notice of readiness in consultation with the operations manager, phrasing any subsequent notices as “This Notice of Readiness is tendered without prejudice to the validity of any N.O.R. previously tendered”.

Note: Use the form DRY 10 - Notice of Readiness.

###### Maximum Cargo Intake Whilst Under Charter

In case of differences between the ship and charterer about the maximum allowable cargo intake, assist the charterer to utilize up to 100% of the vessel's cargo carrying capacity.

Do not carry cargo in excess of permitted due to:

- Draught constraints

- Stability

- Stresses

- Permissible weights

- Load line zones compliance

- Any other factors concerning the safety of the ship or cargoes

Note: Submit calculations using form DRY 08 - Pre-Stowage Plan Cargo Uplift Calculation.

###### Loading Two or More Grades

On bulk carriers most separations are natural, using different holds for different grades or commodities.

For physical separations, use tarpaulins, burlaps, plastic sheeting, dunnage, or combinations of these. Ensure cargo is trimmed level, and separation completely covers the stowed cargo.

Break bulk cargoes may be loaded in one cargo hold, provided cargo is marked/segregated by type.

###### Charterer's Obligations

The charterer or their agents shall provide the master with necessary information and documentation in a timely manner under the charter party.

Information shall allow the ship to load, stow, carry, and discharge the intended cargo safely during all stages of the voyage, fulfilling:

- International or national regulations

- Flag state regulations

- Port regulations

- Charter party requirements

- International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners (INTERCARGO) requirements

Inform the operations department if charterers or their agents regularly fail to provide proper information to allow the vessel to trade safely and effectively.

###### Safe Port

A safe port is one where:

- A vessel can reach, enter, remain at, and depart from without any abnormal occurrence or exposure to danger that cannot be avoided by good navigation and seamanship.

- The vessel can lie safely afloat at all states of the tide, unless it is customary to load or discharge while safely aground and there is an agreement in the CP.

- It is politically and physically safe for the vessel.

Note: Owners are responsible for checking if the port is safe. The vessel must verify this when the port is nominated. If unsure about a port's safety, inform charterers and the office, providing reasons and seeking advice.

####### NAABSA (Not Always Afloat but Safely Aground) Clause

When a NAABSA clause is incorporated in the Charter Party (CP), the vessel may be ordered to a berth where it may not be afloat at all times.

Charterers are responsible for all damages and consequences if the vessel touches bottom at the berth.

The NAABSA clause applies only when a vessel is moored to a berth, at buoys, or at anchor.

Master shall:

- Issue a Letter of Protest (LoP): If during the period of the charter, the vessel is directed to a port/berth where it is customary to lie safely aground as stipulated in the charter party. This draws attention to the charterer and/or his agent at the port about facts or incidents that may affect the performance of the loading/discharging operation or cause damage to the vessel.

Note: Charterers/Agents are not obliged to shift the vessel elsewhere for loading in case of grounding.

- Issue a Note of Protest (NoP): If it is feared that the ship may have sustained damage due to lying safely aground in a tidal port, within 24 hours of the occurrence or on arrival at the next port.

- If the master believes that entry to a port or a specific berth is not advisable due to tidal information and cargo commitments, he must immediately notify his concerns to the charterer/agents and the chartering department.

- If the ship has laid aground, immediately after refloating and sailing out from the port, a sounding followed by an internal inspection of all ballast tanks must be carried out. The technical/operations department must be advised of the results, and any deformity or damage to internals must be reported using the Ballast Tank Inspection form.

##### Bulk Carrier’s Stability

###### Introduction

Bulk carriers are designed to carry dry bulk cargo, including grain, coal, iron ore, etc.

They must be able to carry grain cargoes without shifting boards in accordance with Chapter VI of SOLAS (1974) and comply with the required minimum stability criteria of the International Code on Intact Stability, 2008 (2008 IS CODE).

Solid bulk cargoes are usually loaded by pouring directly into a ship’s cargo holds, forming a conical pile with a distinctive slope angle called the Angle of Repose.

Stress, intact, and damage stability are crucial factors that govern the overall stability of the ship.

When transporting high-density materials, careful evaluation is required to reduce the possibility of sailing with an excessively large GM and high stress, resulting in violent seaway motion.

###### Intact stability

Vessel stability must meet intact stability requirements during all stages of the voyage, complying with the 2008 IS CODE, part A.

For a cargo vessel, the intact stability requirements are as follows:

- Initial GM or metacentric height should not be less than 0.15 m.

- Righting lever (GZ) should be at least 0.2 m and angle of heel (θ) ≥ 30°.

- Maximum righting lever shall occur at an angle of heel not less than 25°.

- The area of the GZ curve should be at least:

- 0.055 m-radian up to θ = 30°

- 0.090 m-radian up to θ = 40°

- 0.03 m-radian between 30° and 40° or between 30° and the angle of down flooding.

Note: The angle of down flooding is the angle at which deck immersion occurs, leading to water ingress.

- Stability condition and printout from LOADICATOR must be available on the bridge.

- Calculate stability condition every 3 days and review it by the master in case of longer voyages.

- Keep records of all stability calculations onboard for a minimum of 2 years.

- Chief officer and Officer of the Watch (OOW) must:

- Perform manual stability calculation upon joining the vessel.

- Conduct stability calculations during any emergency drill involving incidents affecting stability, e.g., flooding due to grounding or collision.

###### Damage Stability

Damage stability criteria vary from ship to ship, with requirements specified in SOLAS Chapter II-1. It may include single compartment flooding, multi-compartment flooding, engine room flooding, etc.

Ship-Specific Damage Stability

Ensure the vessel carrying cargo:

- Is operated per loading conditions approved for the applicable damage stability requirements.

- Has been assessed for compliance using approved damage stability KG/GM limit curves.

- Has an onboard damage stability program acceptable to the administration based on:

      - Intact Stability approval required by Load Line Convention (ILLC) for all vessels after 21st July 1968.

      - SOLAS 74 amended 2009, Regulation 5-1 of Chapter II-1, Part B-1.

      - International Code on Intact Stability, 2008 (2008 IS CODE).

###### Bending and Shear Stress

Shear forces and bending moments on a ship’s structure generate shear and bending stresses. Requirements for stability, bending, and shear stress of the ship include:

- Knowing the distribution and availability of fuel/freshwater for the voyage.

- Considering the consumption and supply of bunkers, freshwater, and other variables.

- Ensuring draft and trim are acceptable at all voyage stages.

- Keeping shearing force, bending moments, and torsional stress within acceptable limits throughout the voyage.

- Note: Consider ballast exchanges as per the Ballast Water Management Certificate (D-1) or local regulations.

- Ensuring cargo weight does not exceed the permitted tank top strength.

- Maintaining block loading limits as set by the class.

- Stability calculations by the chief officer for departure and arrival conditions, countersigned by the master. These records should be filed onboard for future reference.

###### Pre-Loading Considerations

When loading, discharging, ballasting, or de-ballasting, follow a predetermined sequence, considering:

- Loading or discharging sequence.

- Cargo securing and maximum metacentric height for deck cargo (e.g., timber or project cargoes).

- Bunker consumption en route.

- Maximum departure and arrival drafts.

- Free surface effects.

- Load Line Zones to be transited during the voyage.

- Limits of stability and stress calculation equipment and methods.

- Ensuring shear forces and bending moments for harbor conditions are not exceeded while alongside.

- Never sailing from a port with exceeding seagoing limits for shear forces and bending moments.

Maintain permissible limits and advise masters if the vessel is likely to exceed stress, stability, or draft conditions.

###### Stability Criteria for Grain Regulations

Intact stability criteria as per the Grain Regulations (A.749 (18), MSC.23(59), Chapter VI, SOLAS 1974) require meeting the following during the voyage, considering heeling moments due to dry bulk cargo shift:

- References

- International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code (IMSBC Code)

- SOLAS Chapter XII Additional Safety Measures for Bulk Carriers

- Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers (BLU Code)

- International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG Code)

- MARPOL

###### Typical Stability Information Onboard

Stability Information Booklet (SIB) – Standard Loading Conditions: The stability information booklet includes loading cases approved for intact stability, damage stability (where applicable), and strength requirements. Damage stability information may be in a separate booklet, but the SIB is the primary document and covers both intact and damage stability (where applicable).

Stability Information Booklet (SIB) – Allowable Limit Curves: The SIB often includes KGmax or GMmin limit curves that allow the master to evaluate stability for a range of conditions; however, these may only be for intact stability.

Stability Loading Program (i.e., Loading Instrument): Software that performs longitudinal strength and stability calculations for any loading condition. The software may or may not verify damage stability compliance. Presence of damage stability capability can be confirmed if the program or user manual references the SOLAS Code or if the program has a damage stability option.

Note: Verify the Marine Design Appraisal Document for software capabilities.

Stability Information requirements

The master shall ensure the following:

- The ship's master should provide a SIB approved or provisionally approved (for new ships or ships that have recently changed flag) by the classification society on behalf of the flag. This can be demonstrated by the presence of an approval statement on the first few pages of the SIB.

- The SIB should be in the working language of the ship or at least in English. The master should be able to demonstrate his understanding of the SIB in the language it is written.

- Where required by SOLAS, the vessel should have evidence of damage stability approval for all the loading conditions included in the SIB. A useful indication that the SIB has been assessed for damage stability is that the SIB is stamped as complying with SOLAS.

- Loading conditions that are not significantly different from existing approved loading conditions may be considered acceptable.

Stability Guidance on deviation from Loading Manual

The loading conditions in the stability booklet illustrate the vessel's operation range and compliance with regulations required for the ship, including:

- Freeboard

- Longitudinal strength

- Intact and damage stability criteria

A loading case that differs from those in the Loading Manual must be investigated to ensure these criteria are met. This can be done using a class-approved loading computer with reliable results.

Note: The loading software and test loading conditions must be Class Approved.

If deviation is required due to trade or cargo needs, inform the operations department to arrange Class and Flag state approval. Include the following documents in the request:

- Risk Assessment

- Load Computer printouts

- Any other relevant information (e.g., operations requirements, requests from charterers)

###### Arrival / Departure Sailing Condition

- If the ship is not loaded as per an approved condition in the SIB, it is acceptable if written authority from flag/class has been obtained that this alternative loading condition is satisfactory. This will normally be in the form of printed loading conditions, in addition to those included in the SIB. The additional loading conditions must be accompanied by an approval statement.

- Assessing an alternate loading condition by referring to critical damage KGf or GMf data in the approved SIB would be an acceptable alternative. The limiting KGf or GMf limits should be clearly presented with sufficient guidance to ensure they are correctly applied.

- The presence of damage stability capability can be confirmed if the program or user manual references SOLAS / International Convention of Load Line or if the program has a damage stability option.

To avoid detention of the vessel, the master shall ensure compliance with point 1, 2, or 3, and that the vessel's current arrival/departure sailing conditions are demonstrated as required by these points.

###### Stability when dry docking

Prior to entering drydocks, a complete stability calculation must be undertaken.

Details of the calculation must be given to the dock master before entering the dock.

A full set of soundings and tank readings must be taken just as the ship takes the blocks.

All ship's staff should be informed that while in dry docks, the loading, discharging, or moving of weights greater than 1 ton must be reported to the chief officer.

A full stability calculation must be undertaken prior to flooding the dock, including all weights loaded onto or taken off the ship during the docking period.

A full set of soundings must be taken when the dock is being flooded just before floatation, and the stability calculation adjusted as necessary.

##### Cargo Documentation

###### Introduction

File the documentation relating to the cargo and cargo operations sequentially. These documents are important to defend against possible cargo claims.

###### Responsibilities

The chief officer shall maintain files of all cargo documentation.

###### Cargo documents

The following documents must be available on board before loading, with copies sent to the operations department:

- Cargo Shippers Declaration or Cargo declaration

- Transportable Moisture Limit Certificate (TML)

- Moisture Content Certificate

- Cargo Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)

Based on the characteristics of the cargo, conduct a risk assessment and ensure crew awareness and/or training.

Post the following documents in the locations listed:

- Cargo Control Room (CCR) or on the cargo notice board

- Officers' recreation room

- Crew recreation room

- Bridge

- Engine control room

- Fireproof containers with the ship's fire plan (port/starboard side)

Request the appropriate documents from the shippers and/or via agents before starting loading operations. If the documents are not provided:

- Issue a letter of protest.

- Inform the company immediately.

###### Cargo Shippers Declaration or Cargo Declaration

The “shipper’s declaration” or “cargo declaration” is a document prepared by the shippers and presented to the master prior to any loading operations as per the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code, which regulates information for solid bulk cargo.

###### Transportable Moisture Limit Certificate (TML)

The TML of a cargo that may liquefy is the maximum moisture content considered safe for carriage in ships not complying with the special provisions of 7.3.2. Keep this document with the voyage cargo files.

###### Moisture Content Certificate

Moisture content represents the portion of a representative sample consisting of water, ice, or other liquid as a percentage of the total mass of that sample (IMSBC Code). Keep this document with the voyage cargo files.

###### Cargo Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)

For dangerous goods loaded in bulk, the MSDS must include the name of the material, IMO Class, UN Number, or BC Number.

###### Cargo Manifests

A cargo manifest is usually prepared by the agent at the loading port or by the master while the vessel is en route to the discharge port. It lists the quantity of cargo parcels loaded together with their stowage position and provides readily available data for customs authorities and agents at the discharge port.

###### Dangerous Cargo Manifest

The stowage of dangerous cargoes must be checked against the IMDG and IMSBC Codes and the vessel’s Document of Compliance for the carriage of dangerous goods. A detailed list of all dangerous cargoes on board should be posted on the bridge and in the cargo office at all times while dangerous cargoes are on board. This list should include:

- Proper shipping name, including the technical name, of each dangerous cargo

- Quantity of each type of dangerous cargo on board

- Net weight (excluding the box)

- Port of loading and discharging

- Type of packaging

- Primary and subsidiary hazard classes

- UN number

- Stowage position

No dangerous cargo must be loaded on board without proper transportation documents. These documents must be presented to the vessel for verification before loading commences.

###### Hold Inspection Certificate

A report issued by the surveyor acting on behalf of the owners and shippers, or the charterers or port authority, after verifying that the ship’s hold is ready to receive the intended cargo.

##### Bulker Operations - General Precautions

###### Checklists

The chief officer shall complete the Ship/Shore safety checklist as per form 14A/14B or any terminal equivalent before starting cargo operations.

##### Load Lines Zones and Calculations

The "International Convention on Load Lines 1966" places restrictions on ships carrying cargoes to ensure the safety of the ship, cargo, and personnel by keeping a minimum freeboard. The Load Line convention divides the world into different load lines zones. Each vessel is assigned a freeboard based on the load line marks permanently marked on its sides and details contained in the Load Line Certificate. Do not exceed load line restrictions along the voyage.

##### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Wear appropriate PPE. Wear high-visibility vests when working on deck during cargo operations.

Note: Refer to Ch. 7.07 Company Clothing and Protective Equipment.

##### Overriding Key-Operated Alarms

Overriding safety devices, trips, and alarms during normal operations is NOT allowed. Where an overriding switch is operated by a key, the key must be kept under the control of the Chief Officer. The Master’s permission must be obtained before any safety device or trip is overridden.

##### Deck and Cargo Lighting

Maintain adequate levels of illumination in the cargo areas. Rig portable lights as a temporary measure if unable to repair fixed lights. Check the following:

- All lights are operational for safe working during darkness.

- Fitted with shade glasses and, if required, protective grills.

- Do not hang the lights by their wires – use a separate line.

- Cover plug points when not in use.

Areas below side-hatch covers and cross-decks may have inadequate lighting. Limit the movement of personnel to marked walkways during hours of darkness. Crew must carry flashlights and, if necessary, provide portable lights in such areas.

###### Hot Work

Do not carry out any hot work in port without obtaining permission from port authority and office. If the cargo hold is carrying/has carried flammable/dangerous cargo, confirm the space is safe for performing hot work. Refer to Chapter 5.3.3 Hot Work (Dry) for further guidance.

##### Hazards of a Cargo Hold Atmosphere

Containers loaded in cargo holds of a container ship may contain hazardous atmosphere when personnel enter the hold due to the following possible reasons:

- Cargoes liable to cause oxygen depletion, e.g., metals, coals, forest products.

- Accumulation of dangerous gases in cargo spaces or in adjacent spaces.

- Group ‘B’ cargo oxidizing substances.

###### Cargo Hold Entry Precautions

Comply with vessel-specific Entry into Cargo Holds Checklist Form DRY 06. Use this checklist for monitoring cargo hold entry considering the cargo residues may deplete oxygen in the cargo holds.

CAUTION: Avoid entry into cargo holds unless necessary for monitoring cargo.

For other enclosed space entries, refer to procedures in the chapter ‘Enclosed Space Entry’.

##### Fire Fighting for Cargo Holds

Possible causes of fire on board:

- Dust created by certain cargoes may constitute an explosion hazard.

- Flammable gases emitted by certain bulk cargoes may give rise to a fire or explosion hazard.

- Incompatible materials which may react dangerously.

- Materials liable to spontaneous combustion.

- Smoking and the use of naked flames.

- Hot work.

Cargo holds have the following means to suppress a fire:

- Fire Hoses

Note: Any part of the empty cargo space must be able to be reached by two jets of water from two separate, single lengths of hose.

- Fixed Fire Fighting System (CO2)

- Fire detection system for cargo holds: Combined smoke extraction and carbon dioxide (CO2) system

For firefighting contingencies, follow IMS Ch. 7.01 and the Emergency Manual.

##### Emergency Response

Keep the equipment ready for protecting the vessel and the environment.  Refer to IMS Chapter 6 and SOPEP MAnula.

- No-smoking notice

- No visitors notice

- Security notice

##### Scuppers & Save-alls

Before starting cargo operations:

- Plug all deck scuppers.

- Plug the save-alls at the bunker manifolds, hydraulic mooring winches, fuel tank air vents, and hydraulic cylinder oil jacks for hatch covers.

Note: Test the scupper plugs and save-all plugs for a tight fit.

Drain accumulated water periodically, after approval of the OOW & terminal.

Replace scupper plugs immediately afterward.

The crew member draining water should:

- Never leave the location.

- Continuously monitor the overboard side.

- Immediately close scuppers upon sighting any oil sheen or traces in the water.

- Inform the OOW if oil traces are observed in the water.

##### Opening/Closing Hatch covers, Cargo Hold Access Hatch

Special attention should be paid to the following items:

- Ensure trouble-free functioning of the hatch cover by properly training the crew for this task.

- Only allow trained personnel to operate the hatch covers.

- Prevent unauthorized access to the stowing area of the hatch covers.

- Ensure a good view of the entire operation area from the control stand.

Note: Check that safe operation is possible without let or hindrance. Use clear channels of communication.

- Ensure no persons or loose gear are on the hatch cover panels, which could fall during operation.

- Appoint a crewmember to observe the operation from the opposite side and be prepared to stop the operation in case of any hazard, malfunction, or emergency.

Note: If anything unexpected occurs, stop the operation immediately.

- If the ship is heeled or trimmed, carry out the operation with utmost care.

Note: Check the heel/trim restrictions in the Hatch Cover Maker's Manual.

- Cargo holds must be closed before sailing.

- Reduce operating speed when the cover is approaching the open position, and ensure stoppers are in place to avoid impact damage.

- Initiate the closing of the hatch cover at a slow speed.

- Check the proper securing of the panels in the stowed position.

- For the ballast cargo hold only - open all ventilators on covers for floodable hold during ballasting or de-ballasting.

###### Emergency Opening/Closing Hatch Covers

Failure of One Pump: In case of one pump failure, operate the equipment with the remaining pump at reduced speed.

Failure of Pump Unit (Operation with Auxiliary Pump Unit): In case of a failure of the entire pump unit, operate the hatch covers with the MacGregor auxiliary pump unit (A.P.U.)

Note: Follow the Hatch Cover Maker’s Manual for emergency closing operations and use of the A.P.U.

##### Hold Bilge Sounding

- Carry out daily soundings of all cargo hold bilges.

- Record readings in the deck log book.

- Ensure bilge wells are clean and well-maintained.

- Keep strainers clean to allow the free flow of water.

- Ensure sounding pipes are operational, not damaged, holed, or obstructed, and properly marked with the CH bilge well number and maximum sounding height as per calibration tables.

- Maintain operational bilge pumps, bilge ejectors if installed, piping systems, and valves.

- Ensure officers are familiar with the bilge pumping system.

####### Cargo Hold Water Ingress Detection System (WIDS)

When weather deteriorates, suspend manual sounding to ensure crew safety and reduce flooding risks.

Use the Water Ingress Detection System (WIDS) for continuous monitoring.

WIDS has two-stage alarms fitted at the aft end of the cargo holds:

One at a low level fitted at a height of 0.5m from the tank top.

Another at a height not less than 15% of the cargo hold depth, but not more than 2 meters from the tank top.

In any dry or void space (excluding the chain cable locker) forward of the foremost cargo hold, an alarm is fitted at 0.1m above the deck.

CAUTION: ON EACH OCCASION OF WIDS ALARM ACTIVATION, NOTIFY THE MASTER AND CHIEF OFFICER IMMEDIATELY, DAY OR NIGHT

##### Actions After a WIDS Alarm Activation

Notify the Master and Chief Officer.

Record the incident in the deck log book.

Follow the risk assessment and entry procedures for enclosed spaces (cargo holds or other enclosed spaces).

Carry out a visual inspection of the cargo hold.

In case of clear water ingress, pump out overboard following the procedure.

For leaking fuels, lubricants, hydraulic oil, dangerous cargo, or other pollutants, transfer to the bilge holding tank following the procedure.

Note: While in port, restrict pumping out clear water overboard; keep it in the bilge holding tanks.

Investigate the cause of water ingress and take measures to eliminate it.

Follow up with an incident report to the office.

##### Ship Cargo Gear

###### Use of Vessel Gear for Cargo Operation

Test all cargo equipment at least 24 hours before arrival (weather permitting) as per form DRY 32 - Cargo Gear Preparation.

Prior to operations, tender DRY 35A - Crane Letter.

Ensure markings on all gear are according to the cargo gear register and certificates.

Maintain proper records of certificates for wires and loose gear (e.g., shackles, links).

Note: In Australia, individual components are checked against the certificates.

Provide necessary familiarization training to stevedores on the use of ship’s gear.

Caution: Pay particular attention during parking/un-parking of ship’s cranes while shore gantries operate nearby.

###### Damage to Ship’s Cranes

If a shore crane damages a ship’s crane, immediately prohibit its use by:

Securing the crane in a safe position.

Stopping cargo operations in its vicinity if necessary.

Disconnecting the power supply to the affected crane.

Locking the access door to the crane cab.

Posting a notice on the door indicating the crane is damaged and not to be used.

Issuing clear instructions to all ship’s personnel that the crane is not to be used.

Advising stevedores in writing that the crane cannot be used until further notice.

Conduct a thorough inspection of the damaged crane.

Request attendance of a class surveyor to inspect, repair, test, and certify the crane's fitness for use.

##### Ship Loading Spouts/Chutes/Grabs

###### Pre-Loading Checks

Ensure the deck and cargo hold area around the spout/grab is clear of personnel.

Note: Cargo hold hatch access entrances should be closed and secured.

Check air draft restrictions to ensure loading spout/grabs can clear the top of the hatch coaming.

Use DRY 35A - Crane Letter.

###### Loading Operations

Load heavy cargoes like iron ore, scrap iron, lead, and other concentrates carefully:

Keep the loading spout/chute/grab close to the tank top.

Start loading at a low rate until a layer of cargo covers the tank top.

As the pile builds, the cargo will spread over the tank top without heavy impact.

##### Accommodation Access

Keep all external doors, ports, and windows in the accommodation block closed.

Designate one door for routine access to and from the exterior deck, clearly marked to avoid misuse, preferably the offshore side door.

##### Safe Deck Watch

Do not leave cargo holds unattended.

Deck watch should comprise at least:

Two deck ratings

OOW

Chief Officer (at start, during critical operations, and towards end of operations)

###### Duties of Deck Ratings

Maintain a continuous watch at the cargo holds.

Tend to mooring lines.

Tend to the accommodation ladder and safety net.

Keep watch at the gangway, verify visitors' credentials, and keep the Gangway/Visitors Log & Crew Shore Leave Record Book.

Ensure compliance with vessel safety regulations.

Check visually over-side for pollution and security.

Carry out fire and security patrols and keep records.

Make safety and security checks around accommodation.

Ensure the correct display of signals and flags.

Assist the OOW with cargo work and operations.

Note: Assist with taking soundings of ballast tanks during ballasting operations.

###### Accommodation Air Conditioning and Ventilation Systems

Set the air conditioning intakes to ensure the atmospheric pressure inside the accommodation is always greater than the external atmosphere.

Do not set the air conditioning unit to 100% recirculation.

Note: This causes the internal pressure to fall below the external atmosphere due to extraction fans operating in sanitary and galley spaces.

If gas is drawn into the accommodation, operate the ventilation system on recirculation and stop all extraction fans.

##### Signals

Display the appropriate international and local day and night signals prescribed for cargo handling operations.

##### Handling Emergencies During Voyage

The vessel may encounter emergencies related to cargoes, such as:

Liquefaction

Shifting of cargo

Fire of dangerous goods

Water ingress in cargo hold through bilges, manholes of ballast tanks, or other pipelines

Contact the office as per the Emergency Manual upon noticing any unexpected behavior of the vessel.

###### Emergencies Involving Dangerous Goods

Refer to the ‘Emergency Schedule’ (EmS) for the cargo in the IMDG Code before taking action.

Note: EmS codes assigned to each UN number start with “F” for fire and “S” for spillage. EmS tables are published in the IMDG code supplement.

Caution: Ensure staff wears proper PPE (chemical protective suits, rubber gloves, and SCBA set) when handling leakages from DG cargo. Water is not always suitable for restricting fire on DG cargo units. Do not apply water to cargoes reactive to water.

##### Double Banking and STS Transfers on Bulk Carriers

There are various situations of double banking operations:

- Ordered by a port authority to double bank where there is congestion in a port.

- Ordered by her charterers to double bank and discharge into a barge.

- Two vessels double bank at a berth for the purpose of a ship-to-ship transfer.

Double Banking and STS Transfers on Bulk Carriers - Procedure

The Master and chief officer shall do this procedure.

###### Practical Aspects of the Operation

Complete a risk assessment for the entire operation.

Develop a Double Banking Plan that includes all stages of the operation:

Dimensions, draft, and condition of the vessels involved

Approach

Mooring

Equipment required

Crew roles

Cargo operations

Departure

Adhere to local regulations and obtain suitable permissions through the local agent.

Arrange appropriate mooring between the vessels or between the inboard vessel and the berth, considering increased forces due to weather and tidal influences.

##### Dry Bulk Cargo Sampling

###### Introduction

Ship operators and surveyors should take samples when loading or discharging bulk agricultural products or solid bulk cargoes. Sampling involves obtaining representative samples for analysis to determine the properties of the sample material. Proper collection of samples is crucial for resolving quality disputes and determining cargo damage causation. Approved laboratories or service providers typically carry out sampling.

####### Handling Cargo Samples

Cargo samples received on board must be:

Double-bagged in thick, clean, and dry plastic bags.

Sealed with a numbered seal.

Properly labeled with at least the following details:

Vessel name

Quantity represented/description

Sample date

Commodity

Lot identifier (if relevant)

Location or point of sampling

Name of the person who obtained the sample

A sampling report, signed by all parties, should include the seal numbers and distribution.

Note: Store samples of bulk agricultural cargoes in a cool, dark, and dry place.

Make an entry in the deck logbook for the cargo samples received on board.

Retain all cargo samples on board for at least 12 months.

Dispose of cargo samples per current MARPOL regulations.

##### Cargo Holds Sealing

###### Introduction

Invite shippers and charterers to seal cargo hold entrances and hatch covers after loading agricultural products, mineral concentrates, or other necessary cargoes.

###### At Loading Port

Send a written invitation to charterers/shippers via their agents to witness sealing of holds upon completion. Use form DRY 24 - Letter for Sealing Cargo Holds.

Upon completion of loading, have all parties witness the sealing of hatch covers, cargo hold access hatch, and other openings.

Issue a hold sealing certificate.

###### At Discharge Port

Send a written invitation to charterers/receivers via their agents to witness sealing of holds before opening hatch covers for cargo operations.

If shippers/receivers decline to attend, still carry out the sealing and issue a certificate stating "shippers/receivers declined to attend."

##### Operation Tools

###### Loading Computers

Test loading computers against class-approved test data every three months to ensure operational accuracy. Record the test date in the deck logbook and the PMS.

Calculate at least one load case (other than light ship) from the approved test conditions.

Note: Actual loading condition results are not suitable for checking the computer's accuracy.

###### Steps for Testing

- Retrieve the test load case and start a calculation run. Compare the stability results with those in the “Final Test Condition for Loading Computer” (approved and stamped by class).

- Change several items of deadweight (tank weights and cargo weight) to change the draft or displacement by at least 10%. Ensure the results differ logically from the approved test condition.

- Restore the initial test condition and compare the results. Confirm the replication of relevant input and output data.

- Alternatively, select one or more test conditions, perform the test calculation, and verify the results against the approved test conditions.

- Inform the company immediately if any inaccuracies are discovered.

###### Hydrometers

Use a glass hydrometer designed for draft surveys to determine water density at the time of taking the drafts.

Hydrometers should be marked:

Medium surface tension

Apparent density in kg/l scale range between 0.990 to 1.040 (1.000 kg/l = 1.000 t/m³)

Instrumental standard 15° C.

Provide a certificate of calibration with a maximum error not exceeding ‘x’ kg/l tested against a national standard.

Apply the hydrometer index error, if any, as quoted on the certificate.

Do not apply any correction for temperature.

    - Note: Keep a copy of the certificates on board for inspection.

### 8.1.2 Ballast Passage - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Ballast Water

###### Introduction

The BWM Convention came into force on 8th September 2017.

Vessels are required to manage ballast water on every voyage by it using an approved water treatment system (D-2 method).

Ballast water exchange (D-1 method) can be used only in exceptional cases where:

- The authorities of the destination port require this method

- In case of BWTS failures, with the approval of Company, Flag State and Authorities in the destination port

To avoid complications, always ask your agent to approach local authorities at the destination port to advise you on local requirements.

Determine if you must arrive with ballast water treated or exchanged at the destination port.

Maintain the following for each voyage, regardless of whether you will need to record any local forms for ballast water exchange or treatment:

- A ballast water record book

- A ballast water management file containing:

- Ballast water handling log

- IMO ballast water reporting form

- Ballast exchange plan, if required

Ballast Order Book:

Orders to ballast or de-ballast a tank must be given in writing by the chief officer to the duty engineer. The duty engineer must inform the chief officer when the operation is completed.

Note: When a ballast control room is located outside the machinery space, the chief officer is still required to inform the duty engineer in writing of his intentions to ballast or de-ballast tanks. Upon completion of the operation, the chief officer must inform the duty engineer and ensure the overboard discharge valve is shut.

Vessels trading within one COTP zone in the USA should confirm the ballast water management requirements with the COTP, via Agent.

Note: refer to Chapter 8.1.7 – Ballast Water Management for further guidance

###### Ballast Operation

When planning ballasting operations, consider the following factors:

- Trim and stability parameters of the vessel

- Weather conditions expected during the voyage

- Any special requirements from the charterers, such as Trim Optimization

- Any draft or air draft limitations applicable for the port

- Complete form TANK 15 - BALLAST EXCHANGE PLAN, if required

When conducting ballast operations, follow these points:

- Before ballasting, confirm air vents are in the open position.

- Use the Ballast Water Treatment System

- Avoid taking ballast in double bottom tanks in rivers or tidal harbors to prevent filter clogging from sediments or mud. If necessary, try to ballast during high water.

- Avoid over-pressurizing tanks with pumps, as this can lead to structural and cargo damage.

Take soundings and record them in form TANK 16 - BALLAST WATER HANDLING LOG as per the Ballast Water Management Plan (BWMP). Plan all ballasting and de-ballasting operations to avoid excessive list and trim. Prevent ballast water from overflowing and going overboard while in port.

Upon completion of ballast operations, the duty officer shall ensure all pumps are shut down and all valves properly closed.

Note: Incidents of ballast tanks being holed during the carriage of cargo have been reported. When tanks are ballasted, they can cause flooding of holds and damage the cargo. Monitor the ballasting operation closely and sound bilges periodically to check for any water accumulation, which gives early warning of any leakages in the ballast tank.

Complete form TANK 17 - BALLAST WATER REPORTING FORM for reporting ballast water management on board to shore authorities.

For ballast cargo holds, refer to IMS Ch. 4.1.6 Difficult conditions / Heavy Weather Ballasting Guidance for Bulk Carriers.

##### Cargo Hold Cleaning and Residues Disposal

###### Introduction

Follow safety measures and procedures described in the IMSBC Code for efficient hold cleaning and protection of the environment.

Owners/Charterers may provide specific instructions for cargo hold cleaning requirements as per cargo shippers/receivers.

These instructions provide information for proper hold cleaning preparation, including:

- Cleaning standard required

- Cargo/type

- Handling/stowage and disposal of washings at sea

- Relevant regulations

Note: The vessel’s management should cooperate to jointly plan and carry out the hold cleaning operation.

Cleaning holds may be required due to:

- Preparing cargo holds for loading cargo incompatible with the previous one

- Minimum MARPOL requirements

- Ballasting in adverse weather conditions

- Preparing vessel's cargo holds for inspection, maintenance, or repair

- Removal of sediment

- Dry dock preparation

As trade requirements dictate, wash cargo holds to meet cleaning grade requirements per the company’s instructions for the intended voyage.

###### Evaluation of the Cargo Hold Cleaning Standard

Clean cargo holds after considering the following points:

- Guidelines in these instructions

- Instructions from the charterer

- Special instructions from the company

- Evaluation of specific conditions by the vessel's management and/or Pool

- Engaged on a shuttle service carrying the same cargo

- Provisions of MARPOL Annex V for disposal of cargo residues

- Prepare and submit the cleaning plan using form DRY 13A - Cargo Hold Cleaning Report

In the dry bulk trades, there are essentially five grades of hold cleanliness standard:

- Hospital clean or stringent cleanliness: Holds must have 100% intact paint coatings on all surfaces, including the tank top, all ladder rungs, and undersides of hatches. Required for certain cargoes like kaolin/China clay, mineral sands (including zircon, barytes, rutile sand, ilmenite, fluorspar, chrome ore, soda ash), rice in bulk, and high grades of wood pulp.

- Grain clean or high cleanliness: This is the most common requirement for bulk and break-bulk cargoes, such as all grains, soya meal and soya products, alumina, sulfur, bulk cement, bauxite, concentrates, and bulk fertilizers, as per the IMSBC code.

- Normal clean: Holds are swept clean with no residues of the previous cargo and washed down if required by the charterer.

- Shovel clean: All previous cargo that can be removed with a “Bobcat” or by shovels by the stevedores or crew.

- Load on top: The cargo is loaded on top of existing cargo residues, typically where a ship is trading continuously with the same commodity and grade of that commodity.

Note: The master should clarify what standard is expected.

###### Safety and Environment Protection Regulations

Follow safety and environmental protection regulations in force during cargo cleaning, such as:

- MARPOL

- SOLAS 74 (as amended)

- IMSBC Code

- IMDG Code

- National and local regulations

If cargo hold cleaning is done alongside a terminal, discuss safety and environmental protection matters with shore installation representatives before operations start.

##### Safety Instructions for Cargo Hold Cleaning

During cargo hold cleaning:

- Inform crew members that cargo hold cleaning is about to start.

- Reduce the crew working on other jobs on the main deck to a minimum.

- Conduct a risk assessment and toolbox meeting.

- Raise awareness for working with high-pressure machines, tool handling, and dusty cargoes.

- Wear PPE as per the matrix.

- Ensure a safe atmosphere inside the cargo hold through atmosphere testing and proper ventilation as applicable.

- Do not use rope ladders to access holds.

- Provide proper lighting for cargo holds for work during darkness, if allowed.

- Be aware of slippery wet decks.

- Secure the access hatch cover with a locking pin before entering the cargo hold.

- Use the “Australian ladder” or “Spiral Ladder” as the main access to the cargo hold (if fitted).

- Wear a harness for unprotected vertical ladders over 2 meters high.

- If any ladders, handgrips, footholds, or cleats are found to be unsafe, prohibit access and post a warning until repairs have been carried out.

- Ensure welding or replacement of rungs, ladders, or cleats is inspected and tested by a competent officer before use.

- Consider a permit-to-work system for work aloft, hot works, and/or other tasks depending on the nature of the work.

###### Cargo Hold Safe Entry

Empty cargo holds that have remained closed for some time may have insufficient oxygen.

Prevent exposure to dust from some solid bulk cargoes by using breathing protection, protective clothing, protective skin creams, and standard hygiene practices.

Dust from some solid bulk cargoes may constitute an explosion hazard. Ventilate the space to minimize the risks of a dust-laden atmosphere.

Fumigated grain cargo residues after discharge may still pose a health hazard.

Caution: Entering the cargo hold must be considered as entry into an enclosed space.

###### Disposal of Dry Bulk Cargo Residues

The cargo residues after cargo hold cleaning are treated as GARBAGE under MARPOL 73/78 Annex V.

After unloading, cargo residues will remain in the holds and on deck. These residues need to be swept up and the cargo holds washed as soon as possible to avoid safety hazards and contamination of the next cargo.

Sweeping, cargo residue wash down, and subsequent discharge of this wash water form part of the ship’s Garbage Management Plan.

All cargo residue discharges should be recorded as garbage Category J & K in the Garbage Record Book Part II, and these records must be up to date and available for inspection by shore officials.

Cleaning of the hold is usually carried out during the voyage to the loading port. If cargo hold wash water discharge to sea is not permitted, it shall be stored on board and discharged to a Port Reception Facility at the loading/discharge port.

Cargoes affected:

- Alumina

- Cement, Cement Clinkers

- Coal

- Coke

- Mineral Ores

- Grains

- Others: All Cargoes as per IMSBC code

National and local regulations govern the disposal of cargo residues and determine whether they are released at sea or landed in port.

###### Management of Cargo Hold Wash Water and Residues

MARPOL Annex V introduced stricter provisions to control the disposal of cargo hold wash waters and cargo residues:

- Cargo residues not harmful to the marine environment can be disposed of at sea.

- Marine Pollutant cargo residues must be retained on board for proper disposal at a Port Facility reception.

Outside special areas and Arctic Waters: Cargo residues that do not contain substances classified as harmful to the marine environment may be discharged more than 12 nm from land. Cleaning agents in cargo hold, deck, and external surfaces wash water may be discharged to the sea, provided they are not harmful to the marine environment.

Inside special areas and Arctic Waters: Cargo residues contained in wash water may be discharged provided all the following conditions are met as specified in MARPOL Annex V Regulation 6:

- Cleaning agents in cargo hold, deck, and external surfaces wash water are not harmful to the marine environment.

- Both the port of departure and the next port of destination are within the Special Area, and the ship will not transit outside the Special Area between those ports.

- No adequate port reception facilities are available at those ports.

- Discharge of cargo hold wash water containing residues is made as far as practicable from the nearest land or ice shelf nearest fast ice and not less than 12 nm from the nearest land or the nearest ice shelf or nearest fast ice.

Note: Please refer to Res. MEPC .277(70) and MEPC .295(71) for determining HME cargo residues and cleaning additives.

####### Implications of the revised MARPOL Annex V:

Storing cargo hold wash water in cargo holds may adversely affect ship stability due to the free surface effect and cause structural damage due to sloshing. Additionally, the cargo hold will not be ready to load the next cargo.

Classification of cleaning agents or additives: Res. MEPC 277(70): Cleaning agents or additives contained in hold washing water do not include any substances classified as harmful to the marine environment.

Shippers should notify the competent authority of the port state of loading on the basis for the classification.

As stated in Paragraph 3.4 of the 2017 Guidelines, solid bulk cargoes should be classified and declared by the shipper as to whether they are harmful to the marine environment. Such a declaration should be included in the "Shippers Declaration" information required in Section 4.2.3 of the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code.

Inadequacy of Port Reception Facilities (PRF): The responsibility for implementing Annex V extends also to ports and terminals.

They are to ensure that adequate PRF are available, especially when cargoes have been classified as Harmful to the Marine Environment (HME) and within Special Areas.

An Internet-based Port Reception Facility Database provides data on facilities for the reception of all categories of ship-generated waste and can be found at IMO PRF Database.

###### Cleaning Chemicals

The vessel shall maintain sufficient stock of chemicals for washing black persistent stains after coal or other dirty cargoes.

When using Non-HME (Not harmful to the marine environment) chemicals for cleaning, refer to the safety data sheet concerning safety precautions and handling.

The quantities for each vessel may depend on recommendations of the product supplier based on the vessel’s size.

Keep inventory updated and submit form DRY 12A - Cargo Hold Cleaning Chemicals Inventory List before commencing the cleaning process.

Hold-cleaning chemicals: Appropriate quantities of cleaning agents or Alkaline-based heavy-duty detergent or Heavy-duty degreasing solution Non-HME (Not harmful to the marine environment) must be available on the vessel prior to hold cleaning.

Coat Barrier Solution (Paraffin wax emulsion): Coat Barrier Solution must be used when carrying corrosive and/or messy cargoes like sulfur, salt, HBI, and pet coke.

This can be stored on board so that it can be applied before loading if the vessel suddenly loads dirty cargo such as pet coke.

- The coat barrier solution prevents stains from adhering to the bulkheads and is easier to wash off.

- The product must be Non-HME (Not harmful to the marine environment).

###### Hold Cleaning Equipment and Materials

The following equipment and materials are suggested for cargo hold cleaning.

The exact quantity of each item shall be decided by the company according to vessel size and listed in form DRY 12B - Cargo Hold Cleaning Equipment Inventory:

- Combi gun: 1 Pc – Useful for the first general washing, delivering a good volume when boosted by deck air connection, and helps in high volume/large area cleaning in a short time.

- 2 sets of Full-Face Mask type Standard EN 136:1998 and 12 pcs spare filter cartridge.

- 4 sets of Half Face Mask Type Standard EN 140:1998 and 24 pcs spare filter cartridge.

Note: No modification on any hold cleaning equipment or strengthening of cargo residue winching davits is to be carried out without a detailed assessment of the scope of repair and requiring office approval.

###### Cargo Hold Cleaning Preparation

Ensure cargo holds are suitable and clean, meeting any special requirements stipulated by shippers.

Hold washing may commence at port if Port Authorities have given written permission to the vessel.

Note: Inquiry and obtain permission via agents, keeping the operations department in cc.

####### Special requirements for certain cargoes:

After discharging coal or pet coke: Coal or Pet Coke leave heavy staining for which heavy-duty alkaline detergents are often necessary. These are applied as an emulsion, need time to take effect, and are rinsed away with seawater.

After discharging cement or cement clinker:

- Thorough cleaning is extremely necessary to avoid cargo residues sticking inside the holds.

- Remove residues during dry cleaning, brushing, or air blowing if local regulations permit.

Note: Pay particular attention to bilge wells and the framework in the cargo spaces to remove accumulation of cement.

- After dry cleaning, chemically wash the holds with Cement Remover chemical using the designated cleaning kit. Apply starting at the hatch coaming, leave on the surface for 15-30 minutes to allow maximum efficiency, but do not let it dry out.

Note: All personnel involved must wear full Personal Protective Equipment when working with chemicals.

- Ensure Chemicals CEMENT REMOVER is not harmful to the marine environment as per MARPOL.

- After chemical application, follow with a seawater wash down and rinse with fresh water.

- The fixed bilge pumps shall not be used to pump the cargo spaces, as this cargo may make the bilge systems inoperative. Use portable pumps.

After discharging alumina: The water used for cleaning the cargo spaces shall not be pumped by the fixed bilge pumps. Use a portable pump as necessary to clear the cargo spaces of water.

##### Weathertightness test for Hatch Covers

There are three main methods to test hatch cover tightness to verify the vessel's watertight integrity:

- Chalk test

- Hose test (Seaworthiness & cargo worthiness)

- Ultrasonic test

On completion of the test, inform the operations and technical departments of the hatch covers' conditions.

Note: In case of water infiltration, refer to the Hatch Cover Operations and Maintenance Manual for adjustment and repairs. Keep records in the PMS and deck logbook.

Note: Include photographic records for evidence.

Weathertightness test for Hatch Covers- Procedure

Depending on vessel requirements and equipment available, assess the test method to be used.

  - Hose test:

    - Ensure the cargo hold is empty.

    - Close and secure the hatch cover as for sea.

    - Assign one team on deck and a second team inside the cargo hold, both equipped with portable walkie-talkies.

Note: The second team in the cargo hold must be provided with a torch light as locating the leakage can be difficult in a closed and poorly-lit hold.

    - The first team ensures that every part of every joint is hosed in turn and informs the second team which seam is being tested.

    - The second team views the appropriate seam and makes a note of any leakage.

    - Direct a water jet by hose from the fire main or deck service line onto each part of every joint in the hatch cover in turn.

Note: Hose testing cannot be carried out in freezing conditions.

    - Hose testing should be undertaken under the following conditions:

- Water pressure: 4 bar

- Hose diameter: 35-40 mm

- Distance between nozzle and object seam: maximum 1.5m

- Rate of progress: maximum 1 m per 3 sec

    - In case water infiltrates the cargo holds, repairs or adjustments to the hatch cover must be carried out.

Chalk test:

    - Rub chalk from chalk sticks along the full length of the compression bars.

    - Close and secure the hatches.

    - Reopen the hatches and inspect the gaskets for any places that have not been chalk marked by contact with the compression bar.

    - Where there is no chalk mark on the gasket, no contact with the compression bar has been made, and the joint cannot be watertight.

Note: This method does not show how firm the contact has been and is therefore of limited value, but it offers evidence of the relative positions of the compression bar and packing for the expert.

Ultrasonic test:

    - The equipment consists of:

- Transmitter emitting ultrasonic waves when switched on.

- Hand-held receiver that emits an audible sound and provides an accurate reading in decibels (dB).

Note: The sound emitted by the detector is like a low whine from a badly tuned radio. The noise will increase when a leaking area is found.

    - It is not required to have the cargo holds empty, but it is preferable.

    - Place the transmitter in the bottom-center of the cargo hold and switch it on.

    - Secure the hatch cover as done for sea passages.

    - Keep the cargo hold access entrance open and, with the transmitter on, determine the “Open-Hatch value” (in dB).

    - Pass the hand-held receiver along all seams of the hatch covers.

Note: If the noise/readings increase and the leak reaches 10% or more of the “Open-Hatch Value,” consider that the hold has not passed the test.

    - Advantages of ultrasonic test equipment:

- Will not damage cargoes.

- Can be used when the temperature is below freezing.

- Reveals the exact location of any leak.

- Accurate.

- Simple to use and requires no special training.

- Compact and portable.

    - Upon completion of the test, carry out any necessary repairs and submit a report to the company and charterers as per form DRY 20 - Tightness Test of Hatch Covers.

##### Pre Cargo-Loading Operations

###### Introduction

The safe operation of bulk carriers depends on not exceeding allowable stresses in the cycle of loading, discharging, ballasting, and de-ballasting.

To prepare the vessel for cargo stowage and safe planning, inform the loading and unloading sequences and other operational matters well in advance.

Determine the maximum amount of cargo the ship can carry:

- Restricted only by the load line regulations.

- Identify any limiting point which will further restrict the amount of cargo which can be carried.

Regulations: The Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers (BLU Code) was developed to prevent accidents or loss of ships carrying solid bulk cargoes as a result of improper loading and unloading practices.

The BLU Code provides guidance to ship masters of bulk carriers, terminal operators, and other parties concerned for the safe handling, loading, and unloading of solid bulk cargoes and is linked to regulation VI/7 (Loading, unloading, and stowage of bulk cargoes) of the 1974 SOLAS Convention.

The provisions of the Code should be applied with due regard to the provisions of the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code (IMSBC Code), where applicable.

###### The Maximum Cargo Intake or Dead Weight Cargo Calculation (DWCC)

Maximum Cargo Intake Calculations - Procedure

The chief officer shall conduct this procedure. The master shall review the calculation and approve the same.

  - Determine the maximum amount of cargo the ship can carry if restricted only by the load line.

Gather information about the cargo:

- Solid Bulk Cargo is listed by IMSBC code.

- Check the cargo is covered by the vessel's Certificate of Compliance with the IMSBC code.

- Grain cargoes.

- Break bulk cargoes.

- Steel product cargoes.

- Project cargoes.

Note: The amount of cargo may be determined by her deadweight or by the volume of her cargo spaces. Stowage factors (expressed as cubic meters per tonne - m³/mt; or cubic feet per long ton - cf/lt).

Calculate and estimate the following consumables:

- Bunkers.

- Lubricants.

- Fresh water.

- Ballast (un-pumpable).

- Constants.

Considering the assessed restrictions, calculate the deadweight available for maximum intake:

- Calculate drafts at the load port and discharge port.

- Use loadicator to distribute the cargo and issue a pre-stow plan.

- Consider structural and operational limits.

While distributing the cargo, consider the following:

- Structural and operational limits.

- Plan a safe departure condition.

- Arrival condition of the ship and knowing the departure condition (stowage plan) to be attained.

- Stress and displacement calculations to ascertain, for any part of the intended voyage:

- Still water shear forces and bending moments along the ship's length are within the permissible seagoing limits.

- In case block loading is adopted, the weights of cargo in two successive holds are within the allowable seagoing limits for the draft of the ship.

- Weights include the amount of water ballast carried in the hopper and double bottom tanks in way of the hold(s).

- Weight load limit on the tank top and other relevant limits.

- Bunker consumption during the voyage is taken into account when carrying out these stress and displacement calculations.

Send to the company/charterers the maximum quantity the vessel can lift, including a full breakdown of the deadweight calculation to request the cargo quantity from the cargo shippers using Form DRY 08 - Pre-Stowage Plan Cargo Uplift Calculation.

The calculation report should include, where applicable:

- Maximum deadweight, taking into consideration the company Under Keel Clearance Policy and any applicable Load line Zones.

- Cargo particulars.

- Any limitations, such as draft restrictions at load or discharge ports and Fresh Water Allowance.

- Bunker quantities, specifying each grade.

- Constant.

- Fresh water.

- Ballast water (un-pumpable).

- Others.

- Trim, list, shear forces, and bending moments.

- The final amount of cargo the vessel can safely load.

Upload the report in the Reporting Software under Cargo Operations Logs for the respective port.

###### Cargo Hold Inspection before Loading

The chief officer must:

- Allow ventilation of cargo holds before inspection.

- Accompany the cargo surveyor and/or terminal supervisor to assess the arrival cargo holds' suitability for receiving the intended cargoes.

- Protect the interests of the company and the charterer during surveys.

The Cargo Hold Inspector will assess the cargo hold condition as follows:

- Ensure the hold is free of rust or paint chips that could contaminate the cargo.

- Confirm holds are free of previous cargo remnants.

- Look for wooden partitions or dunnage that may react with the cargo and ignite.

- Examine the ship’s log for evidence of previous cargo containing materials that may put the cargo at risk.

- Pay attention to previous cargos including seed or grain that may lead to consequences due to quarantine requirements.

- Check for any signs of moisture or previous water damage in the holds or bilges.

- Visually inspect hatch covers at departure and arrival for water tightness.

- Look for obvious damage, holes, and leak points that may jeopardize cargo quality.

- Conduct Chalk, Hose, or Ultrasonic Leak Detection (ULD) tests.

- Forward the certificate to charterers, agents, and the company upon receipt.

###### Draught Survey

The purpose of a draught survey is to determine the amount of cargo loaded or discharged for the benefit of all interested parties.

Charter Party: States the weight of cargo to be determined by shore scale or draught survey.

Cargo loaded by Shore Scale: A draft survey by an independent surveyor will not be required. However, a draft survey must always be carried out by the Chief Officer before the start of loading to calculate the vessel’s figure for cargo loaded.

Cargo loaded by Draught Survey: A draft surveyor is employed. He should be accompanied by the Chief Officer when drafts are read and bilge, ballast, and freshwater tanks are sounded, and by an Engineer Officer when engine room tanks are sounded.

Draught Survey Calculation

The chief officer and surveyor must:

- Accompany the attending surveyors for the arrival draught survey.

- Examine the ship’s documentation and discuss the ship’s present condition.

- Protect the interests of the company and the charterer during cargo surveys.

Note: A well-conducted draught survey of a vessel should achieve accuracy within 0.5%.

Draught Survey Before Loading - Procedure

The Draft Survey procedures and calculations include the following:

- The accuracy of draft surveys is dependent on the care and accuracy taken by the observer, excluding weather conditions.

- No ballasting/de-ballasting, cargo loading/unloading, or transfer of bunkers shall be in progress during the draft survey.

- Ships' cranes should be in the parked position or swung in the centerline or by the seaside.

- Ballast tanks should be fully pressed up or empty.

- Read the draft marks of the vessel at six (6) points:

- Fore P and S

- Midship P and S

- Aft P and S

Note: Reading of drafts on the seaside shall preferably be done using a boat.

- Sample and test the sea water or dock water density where the vessel floats.

Note: Use a properly certified and calibrated hydrometer.

- Determine deductible weights by measuring and sounding at the time of the survey:

- Ballast tanks

- Fuel oil

- Fresh water

- Use the Hydrostatic Table provided onboard to carry out the calculations as stated in the Vessel Loading Manual.

- The vessel’s constant shall be checked regularly. Any sudden increase in the constant shall be investigated.

- The report should include details of any defect or circumstance regarding weather, surface water, tides/currents, or on-board conditions that might influence the result adversely.

- This calculation, jointly carried out with the Cargo Surveyor, will be marked as the Initial Draught Survey.

Note: It is recommended that each chief mate consult the trim and stability booklet for ship-specific notes and randomly cross-verify the hydrostatic data fed into the draft survey program to avoid any possible errors in draft survey calculations.

Completed

- Do not accept any RAIN LETTER from charterers, terminal, shippers, or cargo receivers. Concerned parties should approach the Operations Department via proper channels to obtain an LOI to load or discharge during rain.

Note: Strict instructions should be received to avoid excessive water accumulation in cargo hold bilges or increased moisture content of cargo concentrates.

###### De-ballasting during Loading

Procedure for De-Ballasting

The chief officer and OOW shall do this procedure

Maintain the Ballast Order Book to ensure the duty OOW and EOOW adhere to the planned de-ballasting and stripping plan.

Notify the terminal before starting to de-ballast.

Discharge ballast symmetrically to avoid excessive listing caused by uneven ballast discharge.

Ensure de-ballasting matches the loading sequence per DRY 04 - IMO form load-unload sequence plan.

Note: Advise the chief officer if loading and de-ballasting are out of sync or if there are any other problems.

Regularly sound working ballast tanks to ensure they are being discharged according to the plan.

Sound all ballast tanks at least once per watch.

Note: This will identify any leaking ballast valves.

If an unexpected list develops not obviously due to uneven loading or de-ballasting, sound all ballast tanks.

Schedule de-ballasting to complete well before starting final cargo trimming.

Strip dry all ballast tanks using eductors while the vessel is trimmed well by the stern.

Check overside for discharge quality when de-ballasting starts.

Keep records as per TANK 16 - BALLAST WATER HANDLING LOG.

    - Completed

###### Over the Tide Cargo Operations

An over-the-tide operation is where there is insufficient water for the vessel to remain afloat at all stages of the tide. This involves discharging or loading cargo such that the company minimum UKC clearance of 10% of the draft is maintained.

Procedure for Over the Tide Cargo Operations

The Master and Chief Officer shall do this procedure

Inform the company before carrying out an over-the-tide operation and discuss the procedure in detail.

Carry out a risk assessment.

Note: The risk assessment must include provisions for the vessel leaving the berth if the planned operation does not proceed according to the cargo plan to avoid the vessel touching the bottom.

Ensure the planned operation maintains a minimum UKC of 10% of the draft.

Confirm that information regarding the depth of the water at the berth is reliable.

Ensure tidal height is at least equal to the forecast at both high and low water.

Inform port authorities and obtain authorization for an over-the-tide operation.

Confirm with terminals that they have procedures in place for draft limitations and significant tidal variations.

Take manual soundings around the vessel:

Upon arriving alongside to check the depth accuracy of the supplied or charted information.

During the operation to ensure the calculated UKC is maintained.

Considering the effects of squat if there is a tidal flow.

Cross-check manual soundings with echosounder and chart datum.

Calculate UKC at critical points and send to the office for approval.

Ensure availability of deeper water off the berth and the time required to reach it.

Confirm the time required to stop operations and clear loading gear.

Ensure availability of tugs, shore watermen, and a pilot if necessary.

Agree on procedures with all parties involved prior to the vessel's arrival.

    - Completed

###### NAABSA Port - "Not Always Afloat but Safely Aground"

NAABSA ports are where the seabed is suitable for the vessel to rest at low tide without damage. Care is required to avoid vessel damage, delays, or straining commercial relationships between owners and charterers.

Procedure - Preparations for NAABSA Port - “Not always afloat but safely aground”

The Master and Chief Officer shall do this procedure

Before arrival at port:

Carry out a risk assessment and submit it to the company.

Confirm any official declaration by authorities recognizing the port as NAABSA.

Determine the nature and topography of the seabed to ensure it is uniform.

Verify minimum depths and maximum draft allowed.

Obtain the date of last survey and dredging works carried out.

Check loading and discharging rates.

Review any official guidelines provided by the authorities.

Collect tidal information.

Research the past history of similar-sized vessels touching the ground at the relevant berth.

After berthing:

Ensure information regarding the depth of the water at the berth is reliable.

Confirm the tidal height matches the forecast at both high and low water.

Inform port authorities and obtain authorization for the operation.

Confirm with terminals that they have procedures for draft limitations and significant tidal variations.

Take manual soundings around the vessel:

Upon arrival alongside to verify depth accuracy.

During the operation to ensure calculated UKC is maintained.

Considering squat effects if there is a tidal flow.

Cross-check manual soundings with echosounder and chart datum.

Calculate UKC at critical points and send to the office for approval.

Switch to high sea chest for seawater cooling systems.

Take actions to avoid damage to vessel machinery and equipment.

After the vessel grounds at low tide:

Suspend loading to maintain structural strength and stability.

Calculate the vessel's stability in an afloat condition using the loading computer, noting the virtual loss of stability upon touching bottom, especially when loading deck cargo.

If the loading computer cannot calculate stability, contact the vessel’s class society ERS for guidance.

Ensure the vessel’s hull is not breached by frequently sounding spaces such as double bottom tanks, duct keel, cofferdams, stool spaces, and cargo hold bilges.

Pay extra attention to mooring lines as the vessel may move laterally away from the berth upon grounding.

Be aware of potential damage to ship and shore equipment such as cranes and gangways due to lateral movement.

After refloating:

Arrange an underwater survey to check for hull and steering system damage.

    - Completed

###### Cargo Trimming

Procedure for Final Cargo Trimming and Completion of Loading

The chief officer and OOW shall do this procedure

A final trim pour is a final quantity of cargo kept in reserve to bring the final draft and trim to the pre-calculated values.

Organize and control the operation carefully.

The chief officer shall ensure strict control.

Use sufficient personnel to monitor draft and trimming of cargo.

Temporarily suspend other vessel activities or use additional personnel if needed.

OOW shall give the trimming operation full attention.

Before carrying out trimming calculations, consider the following:

Limiting draft of the ship (restrictions at load port, discharge port, load line zones, intermediate port such as bunkering port or canal transit, etc.).

Allowance for sag for larger ships and/or those loading high-density cargoes to prevent overloading.

As a guideline, for Panamax and larger ships use penultimate holds for trimming. For ships with 5 holds, use end holds.

Keep enough trimming quantity in reserve.

Note: Increase this quantity in ports where the shore scale is not frequently calibrated to avoid discrepancies.

Steps to take before trimming begins:

Calculate the cargo to be loaded by calculating the sinkage.

Calculate total trim change caused by the holds being loaded.

Inform the terminal and confirm:

Total final figures to complete the maximum intake.

Breakdown per cargo hold of the final amounts.

During the loading of the last holds:

Keep the vessel upright.

Check drafts frequently.

Check for any changes in seawater density.

Assign an OOW to check drafts on the seaside.

Consider the tonnage left in the loading belt conveyor when the stop signal is given to the terminal.

Upon loading the total cargo:

Record final readings of the drafts and seawater density.

Ascertain the cargo quantity.

Take general soundings of all ballast tanks and fresh water.

Request bunker figures from the chief engineer.

Take photos of the cargo condition in all cargo holds upon completion.

Print and review the Departure Stability Condition.

Note: The cargo surveyor should carry out draft reading, density check, and condition of hold trimming.

Upon completion of loading:

The master and terminal representative shall agree in writing that loading has been completed in accordance with the loading plan, including any agreed changes. Use form HSEQ 18 - Terminal Feedback.

Crew to properly clean drain channels and ensure non-return valves are free from cargo.

Close hatch covers and cargo holds access and secure for sea passage.

Re-stow cranes in their parked position at the end of cargo operations.

Check all ballast tank sounding caps are in place and secured.

    - Completed

###### Cargo Sampling

Charterers, shippers, or receivers may require a sample of the cargo loaded on board. Follow IMS Ch. 8.1.1 - General Bulker Practices – Dry Bulk Cargo Sampling.

###### Cargo Quantity Calculation

Loaded figures are calculated based on draught surveys, while the shippers' figures are determined by weighbridge or silo measurements.

For non-dry bulk cargoes:

Tallying is common in general cargo trades or break-bulk cargoes.

Volume and weight are measured ashore for each unit and marked for identification.

Tallying is usually carried out by the stevedore company and complemented by ship’s personnel.

Figures are compared and entered on the Bill of Lading, the official carriage document.

For dry bulk cargoes:

Two common methods to determine quantity loaded are Draught Survey and Shore Scale.

Draught Survey: Used to determine the quantity of bulk cargo loaded or discharged by comparing the ship's displacement before and after loading.

Shore Scale: Cargo is weighed ashore, and the vessel can only estimate the accuracy by working out the volume and stowage factor of the cargo.

Cargo Quantity by Shore Scale - Procedure

The Master and chief officer shall do this procedure.

Obtain information from Time Charterers or Voyage Charterers about how cargo figures will be determined:

Draught Survey

Shore Scale

Tally/Cargo Outturn

In case of loading by shore scale:

Tender a letter to Charterers/Shippers via Agents with the following wording:

      - Dear Mr. ….,

        - Please pass the following to cargo shippers/receivers, which is for your attention as well:

        - Bearing in mind that a draft survey is the only acceptable method by the vessel to determine the exact quantity of cargo loaded/discharged, you are hereby invited to kindly participate in such a method with your own surveyor by joining the chief mate in the initial and final draft survey calculations, which he will carry out before and after completion of discharging.

        - Thank you in advance.

        - Best Regards,

        - Capt….

Inform the Operations department and request the nomination of a 3rd party surveyor (P&I).

Obtain Shore Scale daily reports from the terminal/agents and cross-check quantities with the vessel’s draught survey.

Before and upon completion of loading, follow the Procedure as 16.2 Ballast Passage – Draught Survey Procedure to obtain the cargo loaded on board.

Note: For bulk carriers, shore figures should not exceed the ship’s figures by more than 0.5%.

In case of cargo quantity discrepancy:

Notify the Operations Department for guidance if there is a difference between ship and shore figures after loading.

Include the following information in the notification for each cargo grade loaded:

Ship's Figures

Shore Figures

% Shortage

Request that shippers load the cargo difference and confirm space and deadweight availability on board.

If Charterers are unable to ship the quantity of cargo ordered within the quantity stipulated in the Charter Party, immediately advise Charterers and Operations Department to obtain instructions.

Note: If time or circumstances do not permit contact before departure, clause the Bill/s of Lading as follows:

Shore figures

Vessel figures

If the shippers do not allow you to clause Bill/s of Lading, submit a letter to the Shipper and/or agent for signature specifying how much additional cargo the vessel could have loaded if available.

Insert remarks to the same effect in the Statement of Facts.

    - Completed

Cargo Quantity by Draught Survey - Procedure

The chief officer shall perform this procedure, assisted by the OOW.

This survey is carried out jointly with the shipper and charterer's surveyor.

Upon completion of loading, follow the procedure as per 16.2 Ballast Passage – Draught Survey Procedure, and obtain the Final Net Displacement (Final NDisp).

Calculate the cargo loaded on board:

Cargo loaded = Final NDisp - Initial NDisp.

Use this ascertained figure to issue the Mate's Receipt and Bill of Lading.

    - Completed

Cargo Quantity by Tally - Procedure

The chief officer shall perform this procedure, assisted by the OOW.

This procedure applies to general cargo, steel products, and break-bulk cargoes.

A stevedore tally company will be appointed to ascertain and document the quantity loaded.

A Cargo Loading Condition survey will be conducted by an appointed surveyor to identify damages and condition of the cargo.

Upon completion of loading, the following cargo documents will be issued:

Tally Cargo Report

Cargo Loading Condition Survey Report with remarks on cargo condition

The Mate's Receipt and Bill of Lading shall be issued in strict compliance with the Tally Cargo Report and Cargo Loading Condition Survey Report content.

    - Completed

##### Fumigation of Agricultural Products

###### Safe Use of Pesticides

When cargoes require fumigation on board, the Master shall follow:

IMO guidelines on the safe use of pesticides on ships

Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) of the pesticide being used

IMSBC code section on safe use of pesticides and fumigants

All precautions given in writing by shipper/fumigating team on hold ventilation and access

Grain cargoes are subject to fumigation to comply with discharge port requirements to prevent the spread of agricultural diseases.

Dangers associated with pesticide use:

Contamination of edible cargoes

Harm from contact with pesticides; a warning must be given if cargo was fumigated before loading

Note: Inquire with port agents if the cargo is under fumigation or has been fumigated and arrange for suitable masks if necessary.

Reasons for fumigation:

Infestation by insects may be present aboard or brought with the cargo

Satisfy agricultural authorities at the discharge port

Ensure cargo remains acceptable to the receiver

Prevent cargo overheating

Use of fumigants:

Fumigants are poisonous and require special equipment and skills; should be handled by specialists, not the ship's crew.

Note: Refer to MSC.1/Circ.1264 for recommendations on safe use of pesticides in ships.

In-transit fumigation:

Commenced in port under specialist supervision, continuing at sea with only the ship's crew supervising.

Reasons include insufficient port stay or incomplete dispersal of fumigant gases at the planned time of fumigation.

Hazards of in-transit fumigation:

Lack of crew experience

Dangerous nature of fumigants

Prohibited by some flag State administrations

Note: Ensure permission from the ship's flag State administration and the port State administration.

Cargo Fumigation - Procedure

- Risk assessments for fumigation are to be made and sent to the office for approval.

- Verify gas monitoring equipment as per form TANK 59 - Gas Detectors Inspection / Manual Pumps & TANK 19 - Gas Tubes Inventory.

In-transit fumigation:

At least one officer and one rating must be trained to ensure safe conditions throughout the ship:

- Crew briefing

- Familiarity with the characteristics and properties of the fumigant

- Manufacturer's recommendations on detection methods

- Symptoms of poisoning

- Relevant first aid and medical treatment

- Emergency procedures

Preparations before loading:

- Inspect cargo holds and certify by the specialist as gas-tight and satisfactory.

- Conduct training and instructions on gas detection equipment.

Note: Phosphine tubes or a specific phosphine detector will be required based on the fumigant used. Address company's supply or charterer's needs at the earliest.

- Provide at least four sets of appropriate protective equipment.

- Instructions on disposal of remaining fumigant material.

- Required medicines and medical equipment.

- Ensure the Medical First Aid Guide (MFAG) is available.

During fumigation the fumigator-in-charge must:

- Post written notices in all unsafe spaces during fumigation.

- Check cargo holds and surrounding spaces for safety.

- Remain aboard until the fumigant gas reaches sufficient concentrations to detect and eliminate leaks.

- Issue a written statement that all requirements have been met.

- Ensure the ship's representative is fully trained in using the gas detection equipment provided.

While in-transit fumigation:

- Post warning notices.

- Maintain adequate stocks of gas detection and respirators (with consumables).

- Monitor gas concentrations in spaces around the compartment being fumigated every 8 hours or more frequently and log the readings.

Note: The most common method is using a manual hand pump and measuring tubes.

- Do not enter spaces under fumigation unless essential.

Note: If entry is necessary, conduct a risk assessment and obtain an enclosed entry permit. Two people should enter, both wearing adequate protective equipment, safety harnesses, and lifelines. Lifelines should be tended by persons outside the space, who should also wear self-contained breathing apparatus.

- Keep cargo hold ventilators sealed and do not attempt ventilation during fumigation.

On arrival at the discharge port: Ventilate cargo holds on completion of the stated days.

Recommendations:

- Prevent gases from entering accommodation or work areas.

- Undertake ventilation when there is a strong cross-wind blowing exhausted air away from the ship.

- Check accommodation and work areas for gas concentrations.

Note: Evacuate space if gas concentrations exceed the Threshold Limit Value - Time Weighted Average (TLV-TWA) for the fumigant. A TWA of 0.05 ppm (0.07mg/m3) is recommended.

- At least 24 hours before arriving at the discharge port, inform the authorities that fumigation-in-transit is being carried out and provide relevant details.

- Crew opening hatches should wear respirators and check for gas concentrations, recording readings in the log.

- Discharge should be carried out mechanically.

- If anyone must enter the cargo hold after discharge, check for gas concentrations and wear proper PPE.

- Once discharge is complete and the ship is free of fumigants, remove all warning notices and record actions in the logbook.

Note: Make all necessary logbook entries while cargo is under fumigation.

    - Completed

##### Cargo Hold Atmospheres

Section 3 of the IMSBC Code states that when transporting solid bulk cargoes, the crew must always be aware that such cargoes can be susceptible to oxidation, which may result in oxygen depletion, emission of toxic gases or fumes, and self-heating. This includes, but is not limited to:

Vegetable products

Forest products

Ferrous metals

Metal sulphide concentrates

Coal cargoes

Note: Consider adjacent compartments to cargo holds as dangerous enclosed spaces as well.

Empty cargo holds that have remained closed for some time may have insufficient oxygen. Exposure to dust from some solid bulk cargoes must be prevented by using breathing protection, protective clothing, protective skin creams, and maintaining standard hygiene. Dust from some solid bulk cargoes may constitute an explosion hazard. Ventilate the space to minimize the risks of a dust-laden atmosphere.

Flammable gases may be emitted from some bulk cargoes in sufficient quantities to constitute a fire or explosion hazard. Monitor with a suitable gas detector and consider ventilation.

Fumigated grain cargo (either prior to or during the voyage) may still have a toxic or oxygen-depleted atmosphere on arrival at the discharge port.

Gas concentrations, temperature readings, and ventilation records shall be kept in the deck log book.

CAUTION: ENTERING A CARGO HOLD MUST BE CONSIDERED AN ENTRY INTO AN ENCLOSED SPACE.

##### Early Departure Procedure (EDP)

###### Introduction

EDP may be required:

- By the charterer, to save time

- By the terminal to minimize berth occupancy

- In some ports to meet under-keel clearance (UKC) requirements

Masters should check with the charterers and port authorities in advance if EDP is to be used.

###### Guidance for Early Departure Procedure

Prior to arrival: The master requests EDP, or the terminal advises that EDP is required.

Before completion of loading: The agent submits the cargo shipping documents to the master for acceptance.

These documents are returned unsigned to the agent, who must provide the master with a full set of document copies for reference.

Upon final draught survey agreement: The vessel leaves the berth immediately after obtaining the ship's official figures.

Master's protest: The master should protest any difference between ship/bill of lading figures, however small.

Caution: Do not sign blank bills of lading in anticipation of subsequent entry of accepted figures.

###### Cargo Documents on Departure

Vessels on time charter or in pools should normally use commercial documents in the format provided by the charterer or pool. When there is direct exposure to the owner’s interest, use the owner’s format, such as LOPs.

Include the following documents, as applicable, in the cargo records:

Cargo Shippers declaration

Transportable moisture limit certificate

Moisture content certificate

Mate's receipts

Cargo manifests

Loading lists

Stowage plans

Dangerous Goods documentation

Notice of readiness

Stability/trim/draught calculations

Notes of protest/reports/letters/statements to and from agents/stevedores/charterers

Statement of facts

Damage reports relevant to damages to ship/ship's property/cargo/third parties

Cargo survey reports/deadweight surveys and calculations

Originals and copies of bills of lading

Any other relevant documents, such as terminal letters, lashing certificates, etc.

Loading plans, including the plan overview

Cargo documents shall be kept as stated in IMS Ch. 8.1.1 General Bulker Practices/Cargo Documentation.

The terminal representative and the surveyor(s) must sign the letters of protest to indicate receipt, and the other documents to indicate agreement and acceptance of survey findings and the time log. In the event of any refusal to sign, the agent should endorse the document concerned to indicate that the terminal or surveyor declined to sign.

##### Guidance on Issuing Letter/s of Protest

Refer to IMS Chapter 8.2.2 – Letters of Protest and Notes of Protest for detailed guidance.

##### Documentation Requirements when Trading to U.S. Ports

Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC)

This code is used as the first part of the Unique Bill of Lading Identifier (UBLI) and consists of four alphabetic characters. All vessels must use the SCAC code as instructed by their commercial/pool operator, owner, or time charterer.

Unique Bill of Lading Identifier (UBLI)

When entering the United States, all Bills of Lading must bear a unique Bill of Lading Identifier Code. This code must contain no more than 16 characters and must include both letters and numbers.

It is recommended that the 16 characters comprise the following:

SCAC Code

Vessel's 4- or 5-digit call sign

Year of loading the cargo

Month of loading the cargo

Date of loading the cargo

Bill of Lading number

##### References/Records/Forms

- DRY 05 - During cargo operations checklist

### 8.1.4 Laden Passage - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Laden Passage

###### Introduction

It is essential that the cargo entrusted to the ship be delivered in the same good condition as it was loaded.

###### Cargo Condition Inspections and Records

Maintain cargo quality: Take reasonable care to control the quality and condition of the cargo during the loaded passage. Keep accurate records of cargo condition.

Check seals: If the cargo hold is sealed, check all seals are intact and that cargo has not been pilfered.

Sound cargo hold bilges daily and drain any bilge water.

Inspect cargo lashings: For breakbulk cargoes, ensure lashings are working properly.

Note: This is especially important before any known heavy weather, immediately after heavy weather, and during long passages.

Tighten lashings as needed (for breakbulk cargoes, project cargoes, pipes).

CAUTION: If entry to the cargo hold is required, ventilate the cargo hold and strictly follow procedures for enclosed space entry.

Check for cargo shifting.

Inspect hatch covers:

Ensure cleats are in position and tightened.

Ensure drain valves are free and in position.

In bad weather, reduce:

Heavy pitching and rolling

Excess water on deck

####### Cargo Care on Passage

The chief officer is responsible for the care of the cargo and for ensuring regular inspections during the voyage.

####### Ventilation

Ships may be fitted with natural or forced ventilation systems to:

Prevent cargo or ship’s sweat

Remove taint or smell of previous cargoes

Prevent the build-up of dangerous gases

Remove the heat given off by certain cargoes

When using ventilation, continuously monitor the cargo hold atmosphere. Consult IMSBC Code section 3.5 for dry bulk cargoes.

Types of Cargo Affected:

Hygroscopic Cargoes: Mainly agricultural products containing natural moisture. They may absorb, retain, or release moisture, depending on the surrounding atmosphere (e.g., grains).

Non-Hygroscopic Cargoes: Solid cargoes that are likely to be damaged by cargo sweating.

Cargo Sweat: Condensation occurs on the surface of the cargo as warm, moist air enters the cargo hold containing a cold cargo.

Ship’s Sweat: Condensation occurs on the ship’s structure as the ship becomes colder moving from a hot to a cold climate.

Cargo Ventilation - Procedure

Chief Officer shall follow this procedure.

  - Apply ventilation when either of the following rules are fulfilled:

      - Dew Point Rule: Ventilation should only be carried out when the dew point of the external air is lower than the temperature of the air within the hold.

    - Note: If external air with a relatively higher dew point is allowed to enter the hold, cargo sweat will result.

      - Three Degree Rule: Commonly applied to agricultural cargoes. Ventilation should only occur when the external temperature is at least 3°C cooler than the average cargo loading temperature.

  - Ensure the following before ventilating:

      - Fine weather

      - Absence of sea spray and/or rain

  - Inspect cargo holds for any signs of condensation, and apply ventilation if condensation is found.

  - Keep records of:

      - Dry bulb temperature of outside air

      - Temperature of the cargo (via sounding temperature pipe)

      - Times of on/off ventilation

The results must be recorded in form DRY 34 - Daily Cargo Hold Temperature Record.

n Completed nn

####### Fumigation Monitoring

If the cargo has undergone fumigation, follow the procedure from IMSBC Code Section 3.6 and IMS Ch. 8.1.3 Loading Operations/Cargo Fumigation Procedure.

####### Temperature Monitoring

Monitoring temperature during the laden passage for any type of cargo loaded on board may establish a pattern of any irregularities in the observed behaviour of the cargo.

Bulk cargoes are liable to:

Spontaneous combustion

Ship’s sweat

Cargo sweat

For detailed schedules and cargo hazards, refer to IMSBC Code Section 3.2 ventilation.

Temperature Monitoring - Procedure

Chief Officer shall follow this procedure.

- Take readings at a level well below the surface of the cargo. It is recommended to leave thermometers in the sounding pipes.

- Check temperature regularly to detect any signs of cargo heating.

- Implement more frequent testing if heating is detected.

- Seek advice from the company immediately if there is concern about the cargo temperature.

- Monitor temperature at least once per day. Record the results in form DRY 34 - Daily Cargo Hold Temperature Record.

- Keep records of:

Dry bulb temperature of outside air

Wet/dry temperature of the cargo (via sounding temperature pipe)

nn Completed nn

####### Atmosphere Monitoring

Ships carrying solid bulk cargoes may develop dangerous atmospheres in cargo spaces and adjacent spaces. The dangers may include:

Flammability

Toxicity

Oxygen depletion

Self-heating

This information can be identified in the shipper's declaration. The frequency of testing should depend upon the information provided by the shipper and the analysis of the atmosphere in the cargo space. Record the results in form DRY 33 - Cargo Hold Monitoring Records.

For additional information, refer to the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code.

####### Soundings

A full set of soundings of all ballast tanks, bilges, and void spaces must be taken daily and entered in the Deck Logbook. All soundings should be given in centimetres.

Note: Use the terms "MT" for empty and "F" for full. If a space is empty, the sounding should be given as 0 cm.

If soundings cannot be taken due to heavy weather, note the reason in the Deck Log Book and resume soundings as soon as possible.

Bilge Well Acidity:

Cargoes such as high sulphur coal, iron ore, sulphur, and salt produce high levels of acidity in bilges, leading to accelerated and excessive corrosion. When high levels of acidity are anticipated, bilges must be tested daily using pH strips by touching them against the wet sounding rod when bilge soundings are taken.

pH strip paper is chemically treated paper that changes colour when brought into contact with acids and alkalis. A pH value can be obtained by comparing the colour obtained against a supplied pH colour scale. Record the results in form DRY 33 - Cargo Hold Monitoring Records.

If daily pH readings of the hold bilge water indicate a corrosion risk, keep the bilges pumped dry to avoid acidic liquid collecting on tank tops and in the bilge system. Record the amount of bilge water pumped out in form DRY 37 - Voyage Water Drainage Log (Coal and Ores).

##### Preparation for Arrival at Discharge Port

###### The Discharge Plan

The chief officer shall prepare a detailed cargo discharge plan before arriving at the discharge port.

The vessel must be provided with information about the terminal to plan unloading. For ports where the vessel has never called before, please ask the agents in advance and keep the office in the loop:

Berthing prospects

Number or name of berth planned for us

Depth alongside

Maximum arrival draft

UKC

Density of water at berth

Condition of pier (good fenders, safe for mooring, no obvious obstructions)

Whether discharging will be performed by shore or ship’s gear

Availability and bollard pull of tugs

Quantity of cargo by shore scale or draught survey

Days for discharging, ETC/S

Papers to be prepared for smooth arrival formalities

Any reports or forms to be sent to local authorities prior to arrival

Security level in port facility

PFSO contact details

Port emergency contacts

Any other important specific information needed before arrival

The plan must include stress and stability calculations (SF/BM/GoM) for all intermediate discharging sequences anticipated.

The appropriate loadicator printouts should be maintained with the plan. Present the plan to the master for approval and circulate it to the deck officers and the chief engineer.

In case of subsequent changes, resubmit the plan to the master for approval. All deck officers involved in cargo operations, including junior officers, must read the plan and acknowledge it by signing.

The chief officer must liaise closely with the chief engineer on his requirements for services and machinery, such as:

Ballast pumps

Cargo cranes

Deck machinery (hydraulic system for opening/closing hatch covers and mooring equipment)

The plan should cover all stages of the operations and, at a minimum, contain:

Quantity and grade of each parcel

Discharge rates

Stability and stress information

Drafts and trims

UKC

Ballast operations

Hazards of the cargoes

Under keel clearance limitations

Bunkering

Special precautions required for the operation

###### Discharge Preparations

The preparations outlined previously for loading operations also apply to discharge operations.

BLU Code provisions should be considered for preparing the unloading sequence.

Report all deficiencies detected during preparations prior to the start of cargo operations to the master and the office so appropriate corrective action can be taken according to the company’s defect reporting and rectification procedures.

Before arrival at the discharge port, the chief officer shall conduct a meeting to explain and discuss the discharge plan with all officers and ratings involved in these operations.

Make the appropriate records in the vessel's logbook.

###### Pre-Arrival Checks and Tests during Laden Passage

Conduct operational tests of critical equipment and systems three days before arrival and make routine inspections before the vessel's arrival at the discharge port. This allows sufficient time to rectify any defects found.

Tests and inspections shall include, but not be limited to, the following as per Checklist DRY 32 - Cargo Gear Preparation:

Hydraulics system

Portable instruments

Ballast system

Deck

Gangways

Cargo gear

###### Portable and Fixed Instruments / Detectors

Check multi-gas detection units as per form TANK 59 – Gas Detectors Inspection.

Note: If necessary, calibrate these units and record the findings in the port/cargo log.

Inspect UHF portable radios and explosion-proof torches; ensure they are in good operational condition.

Maintain a documented procedure to sample for hazardous atmospheres with portable equipment.

##### Automated Manifest System

###### Introduction

Every shipping company has an International Carrier Bond (ICB) in place with U.S. Customs.

This bond is valid for all U.S. ports;

Example:

- The ICB number for Reederei NORD Gmbh is “991431000.”

- The ICB number for Reederei NORD B.V. is “18C001FIN.”

There is also a unique 4-letter Standard Alpha Carrier Code (SCAC) to identify each shipping company.

- The SCAC code for Reederei NORD Gmbh is “RNKO.”

- The SCAC code for Reederei NORD Gmbh is “RNBV.”

The SCAC code must be entered into all Bills of Lading for cargoes bound for U.S. ports.

For Canadian Ports, the ICB Code is “TM 5156312,” SCAC Code is “90KT.”

Note: The above is only applicable for vessels managed commercially by Reedderei Nord Gmbh, or Reederei Nord B.V. Other Commercial operators have different ICB or SCAC requirements. Contact the Commercial Operator or Office for advice.

###### Responsibilities

The master must provide the required information to the agent and the charterer for filing the Automated Manifest System (AMS).

###### Filing Automated Manifest System - USA

All cargoes bound for U.S. ports must have their cargo manifests sent electronically in advance using the Automated Manifest System (AMS).

The company has appointed WILHELMSEN in the U.S. to act as the company’s agents for filing the AMS requirements once they are received from the vessel.

The ‘Automated Manifest System Information Form’ (DRY 38) explains how the information should be sent. Each time a cargo is loaded for the U.S., the completed details must be sent to:

Wilhelmsen as soon as possible after departure

The charterer in copy

Reederei NORD Gmbh - Operations Department in copy, or

Redeerei NORD B.V. - Operations Department in copy, or

The vessel needs to file the AMS only when she is on a voyage charter or when instructed by the office or charterer.

Each Bill of Lading will have a unique number that should appear as in the following example:

RNBVP3LK92206051

Where:

RNBV – is the company carrier code

XXXXX – is the vessel’s call sign

XXXXXX – is the date/month/year

1 – is the sequence number for the day, which goes from 1-9, 1 being the first B/L issued for that day. If there are more than 9 B/Ls issued, the sequence starts again with the next day’s date entered.

The form ‘Automated Manifest System Information Requirement’ must be completed and sent by email to the General AMS service centre as soon as possible after receiving the Bills of Lading for cargo loaded at all non-US ports.

####### Instructions/Special Notes

### 8.1.5 Handling Special Dry-Bulk Cargoes - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Handling Special Dry Bulk Cargoes

###### Introduction

Dry bulk cargoes are also classified as Dangerous Goods and/or Materials Hazardous in Bulk (MHB), requiring special attention during loading, transportation, and discharging.

The carriage of solid bulk cargoes poses potential hazards and thus requires efficient and safe stowage and shipment.

###### Dry Bulk Cargoes - General

The IMSBC Code categorizes cargoes into three groups:

Group A: Cargoes which may liquefy if shipped at a moisture content exceeding their Transportable Moisture Limit (TML). Liquefaction means that a cargo becomes fluid (liquefies). Cargoes prone to liquefaction contain moisture and small particles, although they may appear relatively dry and granular when loaded. Liquefaction can lead to cargo shift and potentially capsize and total loss of the ship, even when cargoes are cohesive and trimmed level.

Group B: Cargoes which possess a chemical hazard that could create dangerous situations on a ship. Classified within the Code as:

Dangerous goods in solid form in bulk (under the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code)

Materials hazardous only in bulk (MHB): Cargoes classified as dangerous goods in solid form in bulk will also have a ‘UN’ number in the Bulk Cargoes Shipping Name. Dangerous goods in solid form in bulk are classified as:

Class 4.1: Flammable solids

Class 4.2: Substances liable to spontaneous combustion

Class 4.3: Substances which, in contact with water, emit flammable gases

Class 5.1: Oxidizing substances

Class 6.1: Toxic substances

Class 7: Radioactive materials

Class 8: Corrosive substances

Class 9: Miscellaneous dangerous substances and articles

Materials hazardous only in bulk (MHB): MHB cargoes possess chemical hazards when transported in bulk that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in the IMDG classes above. They present significant risks when carried in bulk and require special precautions. They include:

Combustible solids: Materials readily combustible or easily ignitable

Self-heating solids: Materials that self-heat

Solids that evolve into flammable gas when wet: Materials that emit flammable gases when in contact with water

Solids that evolve toxic gas when wet: Materials that emit toxic gases when in contact with water

Toxic solids: Materials acutely toxic to humans if inhaled or contacted

Corrosive solids: Materials corrosive to skin, eyes, metals, or respiratory sensitizers

Group C: Cargoes which are neither liable to liquefy (Group A) nor possess chemical hazards (Group B). These cargoes can still be hazardous.

The IMSBC code specifies requirements for the design, construction, and equipment of ships carrying solid bulk cargoes. Depending on the cargo's properties, special fire protection and ventilation systems are required onboard.

Dry Bulk Cargoes Not Listed in IMSBC Code: If a cargo proposed for shipment is not listed in the IMSBC Code, section 1.3 of the Code must be complied with by the shipper. The shipper must consult the competent authority of the port of loading for cargo assessment and shipment acceptability. If the cargo is assessed as dangerous, the competent authority of the port of discharge and the flag state of the vessel must also be consulted.

##### Solid Bulk Cargoes Which May Liquefy

Sections 7 and 8 of the IMSBC Code highlight the risks of liquefaction and precautions to minimize them. Cargoes that may liquefy (Group A) include mineral concentrates that have been refined into ores by eliminating most waste materials, known to be fine-particle materials with moisture content (e.g., copper, iron, lead, nickel, bauxite, coal, and zinc concentrates).

A list of ‘Group A’ cargoes can be found in Appendix 1 of the current IMSBC Code.

Vessel Heading Guidance:

- Avoid beam seas.

- Sail from head seas to bow quartering seas for better conditions.

- Sail as close as possible to head seas.

- The best conditions are provided by sailing from stern quartering seas to aft seas.

INFLUENCE OF HEADING ON RISK OF CARGO SHIFTING/LIQUEFACTION

Speed Guidance:

- Maintain reduced speed when adjusting the course.

- Increase speed in increments (e.g., 3 knots) while maintaining the course.

- Re-evaluate ship motion and adjust speed accordingly.

Solid Bulk Cargoes which may Liquefy

The Master and chief officer shall do this procedure.

Before Loading

Ensure cargo holds are clean and dry.

Test bilge suction.

Verify hatch covers close correctly and are weathertight.

Obtain from the shipper:

Information on the cargo as per IMSBC Code Section 4.2.2.

Declaration by the shipper (IMSBC Code Section 4.2.3).

Certificate of the Transportable Moisture Limit (TML) from an entity recognized by the Competent Authority of the port of loading (IMSBC Code Section 4.3.2).

Note: TML testing must be conducted within six months of the cargo loading date (IMSBC Code Section 4.5.1).

Certificate or declaration of the Moisture Content (MC) from an entity recognized by the Competent Authority of the port of loading (IMSBC Code Section 4.3.2).

Note: MC testing should be as close as practicable to the time of loading and not more than seven days before loading (IMSBC Code Section 4.5.2).

Conduct a risk assessment based on the cargo declaration to determine if the cargo can be safely carried on board or if additional information is needed.

Note: If there has been significant rain or snow between testing and loading, laboratory tests (not can tests) should be conducted to ensure the MC is still less than the TML.

Caution: If a shipper’s declaration has not been provided, do not start loading and immediately notify Reederei Nord Operations Dept.

Loading Operation

Ensure the deck watch is adequately manned.

Conduct a visual inspection of the cargo being loaded.

Note: Be aware of water pools or splatter on the bulkheads indicating excessive moisture.

Continue to perform and record 'Can Tests' (Follow IMSBC Code Section 8.4).

Restrict water ingress and do not load during periods of rainfall.

Keep hatch covers of all non-working holds shut.

Ensure cargo loaded from barges is adequately covered during precipitation and water ingress.

Note: Do not accept cargo from these barges unless the MC has been re-established.

During periods of prolonged precipitation, request check tests to ensure the MC is still less than the TML.

Ensure the cargo is reasonably trimmed (as per dry bulk cargo good practice).

Caution: If the master suspects the MC exceeds the TML during loading, stop loading, inform, and seek advice from Reederei Nord Operations Department, and issue a ‘Letter of Protest’.

During the Voyage

Regularly monitor the cargo holds for any sign of free water accumulation.

Treat cargo holds as enclosed spaces; mineral cargoes can deplete oxygen levels.

Sound the cargo hold bilges daily.

Note: Free water is expected to drain but can hold moisture at the bottom, developing a wet base.

Consider ventilating the cargo as appropriate.

Note: Follow IMSBC Code advice for the specific cargo loaded.

Monitor the vessel’s motion, especially the rolling period. A change in the rolling period may indicate a reduction in the vessel’s GM.

If the master or owner suspects that the cargo is or has liquefied, immediately:

Contact Reederei Nord as per the Emergency Manual.

Contact the nearest coastal state authority.

Contact their P&I Club.

Consider heading to the nearest port or place of refuge.

Consider measures to reduce the vessel’s vibration/motion.

DRY 37 - Voyage Water Drainage Log (Coal & Ores)

Completed

##### Coal Cargoes

The International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code contains detailed schedules for the carriage of coal, describing the hazards associated with this cargo and specifying the necessary precautionary measures.

The IMSBC Code classifies coal as:

Group B: Cargoes which possess a chemical hazard that could create a dangerous situation on a ship.

Group A: Cargoes which may liquefy if shipped at a moisture content exceeding their transportable moisture limit, particularly if 75% or more of the material consists of fine particles under 5mm in size.

The shipper’s cargo declaration should be scrutinized to determine which hazards are associated with the coal to be loaded.

Potential Hazards

Methane (CH4): Some coal cargoes produce methane, a non-toxic gas that is flammable at concentrations between 5% and 16% in air. Ventilation should ensure the methane content inside the cargo holds is always less than 20% of the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) for methane. If coal with a methane hazard is to be loaded, all sources of ignition (e.g., smoking, hot work, naked flames, activities that may produce sparks) should be prohibited on deck, within the cargo spaces, and inside enclosed spaces adjacent to the cargo holds. Since methane is lighter than air, it may accumulate inside deck houses and other compartments if they contain access hatches or other cargo hold openings that are not gas tight.

Self-Heating, Oxygen Depletion, and Carbon Monoxide (CO): Some coal cargoes may self-heat due to oxidation, producing carbon monoxide, a toxic, odourless, and colourless gas that depletes oxygen in the atmosphere. Self-heating coal should be ventilated only if necessary to dissipate methane accumulation, and any ventilation should be minimal. If self-heating coal reaches a temperature of 55°C or more, it may spontaneously combust. Monitor carbon monoxide levels as required by the IMSBC Code for early detection of self-heating. If CO levels reach 50 ppm or show a steady rise over three consecutive days, a self-heating condition may be developing. Follow listed actions as per the IMSBC Code.

Liquefaction: If the shipper’s cargo declaration states that the coal is Group A in addition to Group B, follow IMSBC Code Sections 7 and 8 and the procedures for Solid Bulk cargoes which may liquefy. Shippers should provide a Moisture Content certificate (no more than 7 days prior to loading) and a Transportable Moisture Limit (TML) certificate (no more than 6 months prior to loading).

Sulphur: Coal from certain locations may have a high sulphur content. If the coal or cargo holds are wet, the sulphur and water may react to produce sulphurous acid, which is corrosive and may damage hold steelwork, particularly if the coatings are not in good condition. This reaction also produces toxic gas and hydrogen. The IMSBC Code requires shippers to declare the sulphur content of the cargo. The vessel should be equipped with a means to measure the pH value of cargo hold bilge water from outside the cargo spaces.

###### Precautions

Obtain from the Shipper Prior to Loading:

Cargo Shippers declaration

Cargo temperatures

Moisture content

Transportable moisture limit (TML) for the safe carriage of the cargo

Sulfur content

Particle size

Whether the cargo is liable to emit methane

Whether the cargo is liable to self-heat

Any required procedures for the safe loading and carriage of the cargo

Cargo hold gas monitoring points must be provided and maintained for atmosphere sampling.

Observe During the Carriage and Handling of Coal:

Non-safe electrical equipment and non-safe torches are not permitted in or near cargo holds.

Hold lighting must be electrically isolated until after the coal has been discharged.

Smoking and the use of naked lights is forbidden forward of the accommodation, and warning notices must be posted.

Prevent gases emitted from the cargo from accumulating in adjacent enclosed spaces. Such spaces should be kept well ventilated.

No hot work outside the engine room and accommodation block without office approval. Refer to hot work procedures for details.

Forward-facing windows and doors must be kept closed.

Surface ventilation of the cargo should be maintained during the passage. Hatches may be partially opened during daylight hours in fine weather if necessary.

During mechanical ventilation, air must not be directed into the body of the coal as this could promote spontaneous combustion.

Maintain the Following Records:

DRY 37 - Voyage Water Drainage Log (Coal and Ores)

##### Direct Reduced Iron (DRI)

DRI is a metallic product used in the steel-making industry, shipped in bulk either as pellets, lumps, or briquettes.

The IMSBC Code categorizes DRI into three types:

DRI (A): Less reactive, high-density variety known as Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) or Hot Molded Briquettes (HMB).

DRI (B): Highly reactive, low-density DRI in the form of lumps, pellets, and cold-molded briquettes.

DRI (C): By-product fines, including materials generated as by-products in the manufacture and handling of DRI (A) and/or DRI (B).

Note: DRI (B) and DRI (C) may now only be carried under an inert gas atmosphere.

Hazards

Contact with water may lead to vigorous re-oxidation, producing heat and hydrogen, which can lead to explosions.

###### Precautions

####### Prior to Shipment

DRI should be aged for at least 72 hours or treated with a passivation technique to reduce its activity to the same level as the aged product.

Shipper must provide the master with a certificate issued by a competent person recognized by the National Administration of the port of loading stating that the cargo, at the time of loading:

Is suitable for shipment

Conforms with the requirements of the IMSBC Code

Has a moisture content of less than 0.3%

Has a temperature not exceeding 65°C

The certificate must state that the cargo meets the loading criteria regarding aging and material temperature

Shippers must provide comprehensive information on the cargo and safety procedures to follow in an emergency.

####### During Loading

Monitor cargo temperature and record it in a log, detailing the temperature for each lot of cargo loaded. Provide a copy to the master.

On completion of loading, a certificate must be issued by a competent person recognized by the National Administration of the port of loading, confirming that the moisture content has not exceeded 0.3% and the temperature does not exceed 65°C.

####### During Voyage

Prevent water ingress into cargo compartments.

Prevent flammable gases in adjacent enclosed spaces.

Maintain holds under an inert atmosphere (less than 5% oxygen and less than 1% hydrogen) throughout the voyage.

DRI treated or manufactured to provide protection against corrosion and oxidation by water and air may be shipped without inerting.

####### Maintain the Following Records:

DRY 34 - Daily Cargo Hold Temperature Record

##### Grain Cargoes

This section covers the handling of grain, barley, maize, American corn, oats, rye, sorghum, wheat, soya beans, seeds, bulk rice, millet, and other similar agricultural products.

All grain cargoes and seed cargoes that behave like grains must be carried strictly in accordance with the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Grain in Bulk (International Grain Code, 1991).

###### Requirements for Loading Grain Cargoes

A ship proposing to load grain must have:

An approved Grain Loading Manual

A Document of Authorization

Note: The Grain Loading Manual includes a worked example of the necessary grain stability calculations. All Masters and Deck Officers engaged in the carriage of bulk grain must familiarize themselves with the contents of the Grain Loading Manual and how it must be used.

###### Hold Requirements

Holds must be ‘grain clean’ or ‘hospital clean’ (refer to IMS Ch. 8.1.2 - Ballast Passage / Cargo Hold Cleaning).

Hatch covers must be in weather-tight condition.

###### Before Loading

Send a request letter to Charterers/Shippers:

Tag seal all cargo holds after loading.

Cargo weight to be checked jointly with their draught surveyor.

Carry out grain pre-calculations as per the Grain Code and verify that the vessel meets stability criteria.

Conduct a risk assessment.

Inspect holds to ensure they are dry, clean, and free of insects.

Inspect wheat’s moisture content.

Obtain a cargo quality certificate.

Obtain cargo information/instruction of carriage by sea from the shipper.

Conduct initial draft surveys.

###### During Loading

Monitor weather conditions.

Avoid loading during rain or high humidity.

Sample cargo and check its condition regularly.

Note: Wet grain, grain that is sprouting, signs of mold, discolored grain, or contamination by rat droppings or insects (dead or alive) indicate poor condition. Call a P&I surveyor for assistance in consultation with the office if necessary.

###### After Loading

Conduct a final draft survey.

Seal the hatches properly.

Get a fumigation certificate/instructions from the authority.

Clause the Bill of Lading (B/L) in conformity with Mate's Receipt (M/R) to protect carriers in case of discrepancies in quantity, damage, shortage, or contamination.

Update grain calculations as per the International Grain Code and verify that the vessel meets stability criteria with the present cargo stowage.

###### During Voyage

Follow fumigation instructions strictly (refer to IMS Ch. 8.1.3 - Loading Operations / Fumigation of Agricultural Products).

Regularly check and record hold bilge, cargo temperature, and humidity using form DRY 34 - Daily Cargo Hold Temperature Record.

Ventilate the cargo holds as necessary.

Prevent overheating of the fuel oil tanks next to the cargo spaces to prevent caking of cargo.

###### During Discharge

Follow the Enclosed Space Entry Procedure strictly.

Exercise caution when entering holds due to increased CO2 and decreased O2 levels.

Discourage discharge operations in bad weather.

Monitor the cargo hold bilge level during the ballasting operation concurrent with the discharge operation.

##### Sulphur Cargoes

Sulphur is insoluble in water but highly flammable. It ignites readily, evolving toxic, very irritating, and suffocating gases. It is also liable to dust explosions, particularly during loading, discharging, or cleaning.

###### Precautions Before Loading

Remove all residues from previous cargoes.

Remove all loose paint, rust, and scale.

Remove all traces of chlorides, especially those remaining after washing cargo holds with seawater.

Freshwater wash and drain bilges thoroughly.

Ensure cargo holds are ‘grain clean’ prior to loading.

Inspect and approve holds to ensure hatches are watertight.

Apply a cargo hold paint barrier, such as lime wash or temporary coating barrier.

Ensure personnel wear correct personal protective equipment (PPE).

Inform sea staff of any potential safety risks or hazards to health.

Note: See the IMSBC Code for specific information.

###### During Loading

Strictly enforce fire precautions.

Prohibit smoking, naked lights, and hot work anywhere on deck.

Keep fire hoses ready.

Ensure personnel working on deck wear PPE as per the matrix.

Sweep clean all trackways, wheels, compression bars, and hatch covers of sulfur dust. Lightly spray with fresh water before closing to prevent small fires when opening and closing the covers.

After discharge, hose down rather than sweep the hold due to explosion hazards.

Apply lime wash or a cargo hold temporary coating barrier to all holds before loading sulfur. Confirm with Charterers and the Company for instructions.

Note: Lime wash provides an alkaline neutralizing barrier and a physical barrier between wet sulphur and the bare steel/painted surface. A mixture of approximately 60 kg of lime to 200 liters of fresh water should be used. Allow the lime wash to dry before loading to form a protective glaze properly.

Maintain Records

DRY 07 - Hazardous Cargo Operations Checklist

DRY 34 - Daily Cargo Hold Temperature Record

##### Ore Cargoes

Ore cargoes come in various grades and types, such as fines, pellets, and concentrates. Some grades and/or geographical origins may cause liquefaction.

Required Information Prior to Arrival at Load Port

Shipper’s declaration

Certificates of moisture content

Transportable Moisture Limit (TML)

Note: If these certificates are not available at the load port, the Master must consider refusing the cargo and immediately notify the office for further action.

###### Precautions

Keep stresses to the minimum possible, not just below 100% of permissible stresses. Remember that loaded bulk carriers have low freeboards and may be subject to massive forces when shipping seas on deck.

Strictly follow maximum permissible weights stated in the stability booklet for alternate hold loading.

Some ore cargoes may liquefy and shift. Follow the references below to mitigate risks:

Sections 7 & 8 of the IMSBC Code for precautions on loading and carrying bulk cargoes at risk of liquefaction.

IMS Chapter 8.1.1 General Bulker Practices / Solid Bulk cargoes which may liquefy.

Ensure clear walking spaces on deck when loading/discharging ore pellets due to the slippery nature of the cargo.

Entry to cargo spaces is prohibited unless the Master is satisfied it is safe and the atmosphere contains 20.8% oxygen and no toxic gases.

##### Metal Sulfide Concentrate

Some concentrates may meet the criteria for classification as marine pollutants under Class 9, UN3077 (environmentally hazardous substances).

The vessel should obtain a cargo declaration as per IMSBC Code Section 4.2 prior to loading and inform the office as soon as the voyage instruction for loading this cargo is fixed.

###### Hazards

Liquefaction

Chemical hazard

Marine pollutant: Cargo residues and washing water are not allowed to be disposed of at sea.

Health concerns: Respiratory system damage, carcinogenic effects.

Note: Due to the above potential hazards, default rules for shipment under the IMSBC Code may apply.

###### Precautions

Avoid exposure to cargo dust; restrict working and access to the cargo area to necessary work only and wear appropriate PPE.

Confirm that METAL SULPHIDE CONCENTRATE is listed in the Supplement of the Certificate of Compliance for carriage of Solid Bulk Cargoes. Otherwise, approval for carriage may need to be obtained from:

Authorities in ports of loading as well as ports of discharge

Vessel’s flag state

Classification Society

Note: Obtaining such approvals can be time-consuming and may cause delays unless appropriate arrangements are made in advance of the proposed shipment.

Cargoes which may fall into this category include:

Zinc sulfide concentrate

Copper sulfide concentrate

Lead sulfide concentrate

Nickel sulfide concentrate

Note: Some of these cargoes may also fall under Category A or B of the IMSBC Code. Reference should be made to the applicable part of the Code for issues related to risks of liquefaction and/or chemical hazards.

Maintain the following records:

DRY 07 - Hazardous Cargo Operations Checklist

DRY 34 - Daily Cargo Hold Temperature Record

DRY 37 - Voyage Water Drainage Log (Coal and Ores)

##### Iron and Steel Products Cargoes

Finished steel cargoes are highly sensitive and susceptible to physical (mechanical) damage and rusting, much of which can occur due to mishandling and external storage before loading on board.

###### Steel Cargo Categories:

Category A - Packed or wrapped

Special quality wire rods in coil form.

Cold rolled steel sheeting in coils and packages.

Coated steel in coils and packages (galvanized).

Tin plates in steel boxes or coils on wooden skids.

    - Note: These products are usually wrapped in plastic-coated kraft paper with an outer layer of steel sheet wrapper. The bundles are secured with flat metal strapping bands. Packing is designed to protect the products from handling damage and the atmosphere but is not airtight or watertight.

Category B - Not packed or wrapped

Structural steels: beams, angles, flats, channels, reinforcing bars, squares, rounds.

Single flat steel plates and bundles of steel plates.

Hot rolled steel sheeting in coils and bundles.

Steel slabs, billets, blooms, mild steel hot rolled wire rods.

Scraps.

###### Precautions

All steel material must be kept dry. Free water must not be allowed to run even over wrapped cargo, as it can penetrate the wrapping and cause rusting.

Steel cargo must NOT be loaded in rain. Letters of indemnity against damage developing because of loading during rain must NOT be accepted.

Sea water must never be allowed to contact any steel cargoes.

Holds must be hose tested prior to loading steel cargoes, and a log entry made.

If holds are washed with sea water, the final wash must be done with fresh water to prevent ship sweat contaminated with salt crystals from damaging the steel cargo.

All traces of previous cargo must be removed before loading steel products.

The load densities of decks must be checked due to the high-density nature of steel cargoes.

Good handling is necessary to avoid chafing, warping, bending, and crushing of the cargo.

Dunnage must be adequately used to bind the cargo into a solid block, even out pressures in the stow, and facilitate re-slinging of the cargo.

Securing cargo shall be in accordance with the cargo securing manual. If there could be a deviation due to the size and shape of the cargo, the Master shall notify the company, carry out a risk assessment, support with photographs, and seek assistance and advice.

Steel cargo is incompatible with all hygroscopic cargoes such as timber, cargoes of vegetable origin, fertilizers, etc.

SWL of slings, wires, and all cargo lifting gear must be carefully checked.

Any presence of atmospheric/flash rust or mill scale should immediately be brought to the notice of the shipper’s agents and the company.

###### Ventilation

Ventilation is required to prevent cargo sweat, ship sweat, or a combination of both.

Careful consideration must be given to ventilation and the loading temperature of steel to avoid sweating.

Follow IMS Chapter 8.1.4 - Ladden Passage / Ventilation.

###### Steel Coils Stowage

Identify and mark solid floors on the tank top.

Extend the marks up the hold sides/hoppers.

Load steel coils in a minimum of two tiers or layers.

In single-tier loading, locking the tier is essential by placing a coil to force those beneath it into a tighter stow.

Correctly position steel coils, ensuring tank top point loads do not exceed the allowable.

Estimate the metacentric height (GM) using the correct vertical center of gravity for the loaded steel.

Note: Very high GMs should be avoided as they are associated with heavy/violent ship rolling.

Key coils are most effective when placed at the center of a row.

Key coils take up any gap that may occur between coils during ship movement.

Key coils placed above different-sized coils ensure the smaller coil takes the most weight.

Pneumatically tightened steel bands are preferred for coils.

Insert suitable chafing pieces between the lashing and the steel’s edge for wire lashings. Lash the standing faces of coils back to the second row.

Secure the bottom tier of coils on double lines of good dunnage placed athwartships to allow moisture to run to the bilges without damaging the cargo.

The first coils loaded should be placed in the wings against the bulkhead and then the row extended inwards towards the centerline of the ship.

Each individual coil in the top tier should be secured by driving wedges between it and its adjacent coils.

###### Dunnage

Apply dunnage between the ship and cargo, and within cargo tiers to avoid damage to the ship’s structure and enable even weight distribution.

Lay dunnage over strong points.

Properly lay dunnage to ensure safe and efficient carriage of steel.

Apply dunnage to create frictional resistance and spread the load.

Use sufficient strips of dunnage to avoid exceeding the tank top acceptable point load.

Avoid deformation of the cargo, especially when loading steel coils.

Protect steel from moisture and reduce possible movement within a stow.

Use dunnage certified for ship use.

Note: Use dunnage with a plant quarantine stamp and certificate of treatment and quantity.

###### Securing

Prevent steel from shifting using friction between the steel and dunnage. Lashing prevents initial movement.

Consult the ship’s Cargo Securing Manual before applying lashing.

Lashings are not designed for the most violent/extreme storms encountered at sea.

Smooth-surfaced steel that is wet has almost no frictional resistance.

Insert dunnage between steel and the lashings to increase friction and prevent damage.

Friction is important to prevent cargo movement during ship rolling.

###### Susceptibility to Damage

All steel is susceptible to rust damage. Rusting is a continuous and progressive process.

The longer rusting continues, the greater the damage to the product.

For steel coils, care should be taken not to displace or break the steel strapping.

Coils may become telescoped, with some laps projecting on one side of the coil.

The edges of coils may be crimped by the careless use of unsuitable lifting equipment.

The misuse of handling gear can lead to chafing damage even when coils are wrapped.

The edge of packaged sheets may be crimped, bent, or cut if they overhang the wooden bearers.

###### Bills of Lading and Mate’s Receipts

Bills of Lading and Mate’s Receipts must accurately reflect the condition of the cargo at the time of loading and should be claused for steel cargoes if necessary.

Owners or charterers often employ local surveyors to carry out pre-loading and loading condition surveys of the booked cargo and issue reports on the condition of the cargo as it is loaded.

The survey report should contain the correct wording of any clauses required.

Any clausing should be factual and accurate.

Note: Useful advice on steel cargoes can be found in Bulk Carrier Practice & Thomas’ Stowage books.

###### Safety when working with steel

Steel is dangerous, and care is needed when working with or near steel.

Never:

- Enter a cargo hold unaccompanied or without support

- Enter a cargo hold without means to test the hold atmosphere for oxygen

- Stand in the fall or swing zone of lifted steel

- Enter a dark hold to examine steel without adequate lighting

- Enter a cargo hold in bad weather

- Tighten wire lashings to the wire’s breaking point

- Climb between stowed steel, especially steel coils

- Walk on or between wet steel

- Walk in the path of a coil that is not wedged – it could move

Always:

- Respect the hazards associated with steel. Work safely and use proper walkways/safe means of access

- Point out loose or poorly stowed steel to stevedores before they begin work

- Stand well back and away from fall or swing zones while steel is being moved

- Wear PPE

- Wear high-visibility clothing

###### Loading Steel Cargoes

Steel Cargoes Loading - Procedure

The master and chief officer shall do this procedure. The OOW shall assist the Chief Officer.

Prepare risk assessment

Toolbox meeting with crew involved in cargo operations

Liaise with the office to arrange a P&I pre-shipment survey to ensure that the mate’s receipts and bills of lading accurately reflect the cargo quantity and apparent order and condition at the time of loading.

Inspect bilges, hatch covers, and other hold openings to prevent water ingress. If deficiencies are noted, repair and inform the office.

Ensure weathertight integrity:

Hose test on hatch covers

Test bilge suctions

Test non-return valves

Proper planning and supervision of stowage and securing arrangements to reduce the risks of cargo shifting, crushing, and chafing.

Pre-departure checks as per form

Proper ventilation (refer to IMS Ch. 8.1.4 Laden Passage / Ventilation)

Visual checks of the holds and daily soundings of the bilges will help to ensure that problems arising during the voyage are detected and dealt with early enough.

An outturn survey will help evidence weathertight integrity and the condition of the cargo at the time of discharge.

Keeping full and proper records of the vessel’s care for the cargo will help defend against claims.

If any incident occurs, inform the office, P&I Club, and/or the local correspondent to assist.

##### Break Bulk Cargoes

###### Introduction

Conventional general cargo or break-bulk cargo encompasses different commodities:

Project cargo: Power generation equipment, subsea systems, cables, gas tanks, modules, petrochemical plants, mining equipment, building and construction equipment, brewery tanks, silos, heavy machinery.

Iron and steel products: Including coils, plates, steel bars, slabs, plates, steel wire, pipes, and tubes.

Forest products: Including wood and paper products

Parcels: Such as malt, fertilizer, sugar, and rice.

Break bulk shipments of smaller lots: Such as big bags, skidded, and palletized cargoes.

Class approval of strength and stability calculations is required for excluded stowage conditions in the ship's Loading Manual or Loadmaster for intended cargoes, e.g., heavy-lift cargoes stowed on deck and hatch covers. Stowage and carriage of break-bulk cargoes can only be performed if the ship has an approved Cargo Securing Manual (CSM).

The CSM must detail:

All lashing and securing arrangements and devices provided on board

Correct application and recommended methods for securing cargo units, containers, vehicles, and other cargo

Type and use of lashings, detailing all transverse, longitudinal, and vertical forces, for a range of applicable metacentric height (GM) values, especially during adverse weather and sea conditions.

Officers and crew should be instructed on the correct application and recommended use of the cargo securing devices on board.

###### Cargo Planning

Detailed information on the intended cargo should be provided:

Accurate dimensions of the cargo

Weight

Centre of gravity

Nature and strength of any packaging

Location of lifting and lashing points

Specific type of lashing material if required

Whether the cargo is fragile and not to be over-stowed

Whether the cargo is suitable for carriage on deck

Whether the intended cargo is a dangerous good (requiring a declaration in accordance with the IMDG Code).

Cargo information details allow an effective stowage and lashing plan to be developed based on the requirements of the Code of Safe Practice for Cargo Stowage and Securing (CSS Code) and vessel-specific Cargo Securing Manual (CSM).

Lashing Point Certification: Project cargo that requires any additional lashing points or sea fastenings fitted will require testing and certificates to be issued.

####### Forest Products

Forest products include sawn timber, logs, plywood, wood pulp, and woodchips. Types of logs carried vary widely depending on the country of loading.

All ships carrying logs must have on board, and refer to, the IMO Code of Safe Practice for Ships Carrying Timber Deck Cargoes, 1991 (TDC Code).

Note: Vessels loading timber cargoes from Canada must also refer to the Canadian Code of Safe Practice for Ships Carrying Timber Deck Cargoes, as the Canadian code has certain modifications.

Main Points for Timber Cargoes:

Stability should be calculated considering the absorption of water in dried or seasoned timber.

Approved Cargo Securing Manual (CSM) in accordance with SOLAS VI/5, which must contain a section specifically dedicated to the stowage and securing of logs and/or packaged timber.

Lashing equipment must be checked prior to arrival at the loading port.

Deck cargo loading limitations must be carefully checked.

Cargo must be stowed considering visibility from the bridge and safe access to crew quarters and for pilot boarding.

No deck cargo should be stowed over sounding pipes and air pipes nor interfere with safe access to the same.

Safe and efficient means of access shall always be provided for all working parts of the ship. Fire hydrants must remain accessible.

### 8.1.7 Ballast Water Management - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Ballast Water Management Control

###### Introduction

This procedure guides the handling of ballast water to control water pollution from shipboard operations and reduce the environmental impacts associated with ballast water discharges.

It applies to all operations and activities on board vessels generating wastewater discharged to the sea.

- MARPOL 73/78 requires that all vessels carry a ballast water management plan.

- The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has issued guidelines for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water to Minimize the Transfer of Harmful Aquatic Organisms and Pathogens, recognizing the potential for uncontrolled ballast water discharge to cause harm.

- Several states require vessels to comply with quarantine requirements for ballast management.

- The carriage and disposal of ballast water can significantly contribute to the transfer of species of aquatic organisms and water-borne pathogens from their natural habitats. Vessels must comply with mandatory schemes concerning the handling of ballast water, as per the procedures detailed in the Ballast Water Management Plan.

- The Ballast Water Management Plan minimizes the risk of transplanting harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens from ships' ballast water and associated sediments while maintaining ship safety.

- Studies in several countries have shown that many species of bacteria, plants, and animals can survive in ballast water and sediment, even after journeys of several weeks.

- The subsequent discharge of ballast water or sediment into port waters may establish colonies of harmful species and pathogens, seriously upsetting the existing ecological balance.

- Organisms are transferred between geographically separated sea areas due to ballast water discharge from ships.

###### Responsibilities

Master: Comply with national Ballast Water Management requirements.

Chief Officer: Designated officer in charge of implementing the vessel’s Ballast Water Management Plan.

Chief Engineer: Maintain the vessel’s ballast equipment, such as Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS), pumps, valves, pipelines, and drain cocks, in good and usable condition.

###### Definitions

Regulation D-1 Ballast Water Exchange Standard

- Ships performing ballast water exchange in accordance with this regulation must achieve at least 95 percent volumetric exchange of ballast water.

Regulation D-2 Ballast Water Performance Standard

- Ships conducting ballast water management in accordance with this regulation must limit the discharge of viable organisms, including specified indicator microbes harmful to human health.

Note: D-2 regulations are met by using a Ballast Water Treatment Plant unit.

##### Ballast Water Management

Vessels must follow Regulation D-2.

###### Regulation D-2 - use of Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS)

The use of the Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS) is the mandatory option.

It is part of the Ballast Water Management Plan and must be used in strict compliance with the operation manual.

If local regulations do not accept the treatment of ballast water using the BWTS, then a ballast water exchange must take place as described in the approved Ballast Water Management Plan.

Note: The ballast exchange must be conducted using the BWTS.

###### Ballast Water Treatment

The requirement for ballast water treatment arises from the requirements of regulation D-2 of the International Convention for the Control of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM Convention).

Fig 1 - Generic ballast water treatment technology process options

Ballast Water Treatment Technology

There are two generic types of process technology used in ballast water treatment:

- Solid-liquid separation

- Disinfection

Solid-liquid separation involves the removal of suspended solid material, including larger suspended micro-organisms, from the ballast water through sedimentation (allowing solids to settle out by their own weight) or surface filtration (removal by straining).

Disinfection removes or inactivates micro-organisms using one or more of the following methods:

- Chemical inactivation of micro-organisms.

- Physicochemical inactivation by ultraviolet light irradiation, which denatures the DNA of micro-organisms, preventing them from reproducing. Ultrasound or cavitation (termed 'micro-agitation') are also physico-chemical disinfection methods.

- Deoxygenation by displacing dissolved oxygen with inert gas injection or stripping it by means of a vacuum, thereby asphyxiating the micro-organism.

Most commercial systems employ two stages of treatment: a solid-liquid separation stage followed by disinfection, though some disinfection technologies are used in isolation. One ballast water treatment technology employs chemical enhancement (e.g., coagulation/flocculation) upstream of solid-liquid separation; another employs titanium dioxide (TiO2) to intensify ultraviolet irradiation.

- Use ballast water treatment plants as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

- Maintain them as per PMS.

The contents of surviving aquatic organisms in ballast water discharged from vessels requiring treatment as per the Convention shall meet the following requirements:

- Fewer than 10 living aquatic organisms greater than or equal to 50 microns per cubic meter of water.

- Fewer than 10 living aquatic organisms less than 50 microns but larger than or equal to 10 microns per millilitre of water.

- Vibrio cholera is fewer than one colony-forming unit per 100 ml; Escherichia coli is fewer than 250 colony-forming units per 100 ml; Enterococcus is fewer than 100 colony-forming units per 100 ml.

###### Ballast Water Sampling Points

- Samples shall be drawn:

- at the request and under the supervision of a port state or quarantine officer.

- for required periodic analyses in the presence of the laboratory representative

- Crew shall be familiar with use of BWTS sampling points and the sampling procedure

- The time required to analyse the samples shall not be used as a basis to unduly delay the operations or departure of the ship.

###### Hazards and Safety Measures

Manufacturer’s instructions must be always followed when operating the BWTS. There are various types of BWTS:

- Systems that produce disinfectant on board by electrolysis and inject it into the ballast water.

- Systems where the disinfectant is prepared on board and injected into the ballast water.

- Systems that use UV light to disinfect the ballast water.

Note: Some systems may use back-flush filters to retain or dispose of larger bio-organisms.

Authorized personnel should be familiar with the operation, inspection, and maintenance of the BWTS, particularly the hazards associated with operating the equipment and handling and storing any chemicals used. Where applicable, a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) should be provided, describing the proper storage and handling procedures for the chemicals.

Caution: Do not store wet chlorine in closed and unventilated areas, as wet chemicals containing chlorine may self-react and produce heat and emit toxic and corrosive fumes.

The quantity of disinfectant needed is automatically regulated by the BWTS. The system should not exceed the maximum chemical dosage and the maximum allowable discharge concentration of TRO at any time. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling chemicals, referring to the MSDS for guidance.

BWTS using electrolysis units to produce disinfectant may emit hydrogen (H₂).

Caution: H₂ is highly flammable. Ensure that the space where the electrolysis units are installed is well-ventilated and that the H₂ sensor is in good operational order and tested regularly.

##### Contingency Measures in Case of BWTS Failure

As the vessel's primary ballast water management method is treatment upon intake and discharge, a failure of the Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS) leads to non-compliance with the vessel's certification.

From the point of certification, there is no difference regarding when or where the BWTS fails; technical failure of the BWTS automatically means loss of compliance.

Therefore, all technical failures of the BWTS must be reported to the Technical Superintendent (TSI)/Operations, detailing the following:

- Malfunctions of the BWTS.

- Ports with challenging water quality (CWQ)

From an environmental and operational perspective, the timing and location of the BWTS failure are crucial, as short-term substitute procedures must be defined on a case-by-case basis. Close cooperation between the vessel, TSI, Operations, affected port states, flag state, and classification society is required.

The Master must inform the Flag State and the authorities in the port of destination (through the Agent) and get advice on the actions to implement.

The involved parties should consider the following non-exclusive list of possible contingency measures, depending on the actual situation and practical feasibility:

- Retention of ballast water on board: Completely avoid ballast water discharge in port by shifting ballast internally.

- Internal circulation after BWTS repair: If BWTS failure occurred during ballast intake and the tanks contain partly untreated water that needs to be discharged in the next port, repair the BWTS and perform internal circulation of the non-compliant water through the repaired BWTS before executing standard discharge operations.

- Fallback on D1 standard: Execute ballast water exchange according to the BWMC and as described in the BWMP.

- Discharge of non-compliant ballast water: Transfer ballast water to another vessel, barge, or shore-based reception facility.

Record all actions in the Ballast Water Record Book and create a Defect Report in the PMS Software.

###### In case of BWTS failure

In case of BWTS failure, the master shall:

- Inform Office and Flag State (via Office)

- Inform the Port State authorities in the arrival port

- Obtain advice regarding alternative ballast water management practice accepted by the authorities in the arrival port and the Flag State

- If D-1 treatment method is accepted prepare a Risk Assessment, a Ballast Water Exchange Plan as per vessels BWMP, and submit to Office for approval

- Consider ballasting the minimum SOLAS safe quantity required for the sea passage

- Keep a full and accurate log of ballast operations and make records available to port state authorities.

Note: Pre-planning is essential to maintain safety where compliance with ballast exchange or other ballast water treatment or control options is required.

Consider safety information when preparing the voyage plan. Report in advance to the national monitoring authority the amount of ballast water on board upon arrival, where it was taken, and whether a ballast management procedure has been followed (i.e., Exchange or Treatment).

####### BWTS Failure due to CWQ

In Ports with challenging water quality (CWQ) the vessel shall, before considering bypassing the system, carry out trouble shooting and identify mitigating measures that could assist in continuing the operation using the BWTS, such as:

- Ensure that the restrictions are originating from the water quality and not from other sources (i.e. maintenance, malfunctions, familiarization with system operation)

- Conduct the operation at minimum operational requirements (flow rates)

- Manually operate any back-flushing controls, if possible

- Apply suitable back-pressure at high differential filter pressures

- Maximize UV intensity, where applicable

- Load, if possible, minimum safe ballast quantity via the BWTS and complete the ballasting in less challenging waters immediately after departure from port

If bypassing the BWTS system is unavoidable in CWQ, then:

- Inform Office and Flag State (via Office)

- Consider limiting the number of ballast tanks that will be loaded with untreated ballast water

- After departure, in less challenging water quality, complete the ballasting using the BWTS

- Before arrival in the next port decontaminate the affected tanks

- Obtain further advice on other measures to be taken from the Port State Authorities in the next arrival port (as per BWMC Regulation B - 4.2)

###### Decontamination of the ballast tanks

Decontamination of the ballast tanks in the aftermath of BWTS bypassing is required to bring the vessel back to compliance with D2 standard condition.

####### Guidance

BWMC Convention requires Regulation B-4 - Ballast Water Exchange, requires:

- A ship conducting Ballast Water exchange to meet the standard in regulation D-1 shall:

    - .1 whenever possible, conduct such Ballast Water exchange at least 200 nautical miles from the nearest land and in water at least 200 metres in depth, taking into account the Guidelines developed by the Organization;

    - .2 in cases where the ship is unable to conduct Ballast Water exchange in accordance with paragraph 1.1, such Ballast Water exchange shall be conducted taking into account the Guidelines described in paragraph 1.1 and as far from the nearest land as possible, and in all cases at least 50 nautical miles from the nearest land and in water at least 200 metres in depth.

- In sea areas where the distance from the nearest land or the depth does not meet the parameters described in paragraph 1.1 or 1.2, the port State may designate areas, in consultation with adjacent or other States, as appropriate, where a ship may conduct Ballast Water exchange, taking into account the Guidelines described in paragraph 1.1.

####### Decontamination process

Replace the ballast water in each contaminated tank through ballast water exchange, flushing and treatment.

Do the following:

- Fully discharge the ballast water from contaminated tank through the treatment process

- Strip the tank(s) to remove the residual water

- Flush the contaminated tank(s) by following below steps:

- Add treated water to ballast tank (minimum amount of water should cover the entire bottom of the tank

- Mix the water through the motion of the ship

- Release the mixed waters

- Refill with treated ballast water

###### Recordkeeping

In the instances when the BWTS has not operated as expected owing to CWQ the following shall be recorded in the Ballast Water Record Book:

- the reason why normal ballasting operations were stopped;

- any steps taken to optimize the treatment process and resolve BWMS technical malfunctions;

- the operational demands that were not met and/or operational limitations encountered;

- the steps that were taken prior to a bypass being initiated (as relevant);

- the tanks which have received bypassed ballast water (tank ID);

- the date, time and location where the bypass took place; and

- the decontamination steps that were taken to recover from BWMS bypass as per the approved BWMP, including:

- the start and end locations (GPS coordinates) at which any flushing and/or exchange took place

- the start date and time

- end date and time

- the method of exchange and the volume exchanged and/or flushed.

##### Precautions for Ballast Exchange at Sea (BWTS Failure)

In principle, there are only two methods for exchanging ballast water at sea:

- Sequential Method: The ballast tanks are pumped out and then refilled following a pre-defined safe sequence.

- Flow-Through Method: Overflowing ballast tanks following a pre-defined sequence to dilute the water in the tanks.

Exchange water using the method described in vessel’s Ballast Water Management Plan.

###### Sequential Method

- The process requires the removal and replacement of very large weights from the ship in a dynamic situation.

- The Ballast Water Exchange Plan indicates the status of the ballast water in every tank at the start of each step and includes the assumed weight of fuel and domestic drinking water (Aft of the Engine Room Bulkhead), estimated draughts, bending moments, and shear forces. The actions to take and tanks involved in each step are specified.

- The original condition is restored after each pair of steps.

- Make a positive decision before proceeding to the next pair of steps, considering the ship’s position, weather forecast, machinery performance, and degree of crew fatigue. If any factors are unfavorable, suspend or halt the ballast exchange.

- Heeling effects due to asymmetrical emptying or filling have been considered so that all steps represent upright conditions. Manage actual operations to prevent developing lists during pumping.

- The steps meet trim and draught requirements for propeller and rudder immersion, to avoid slamming while changing ballast, and to maintain bridge visibility within tolerable limits.

- Avoid under pressure in a tank due to emptying, and overpressure when filling.

Note: The consequences of bulkhead damage, or even tank collapse, at sea are more significant than in port.

- Check each step for conformity with strength and stress limitations. Ensure that the minimum intact stability requirements of the ship are met at every stage and that the allowable limits for bending and twisting moments are not exceeded.

- The figure given under bending moments is the percentage of the maximum allowable at the end of each step, before commencing the next step. Some vessels are provided with guidance regarding Sea Going Bending Moments (SGBM) – if provided, this factor is to be used. Still Water Bending Moments (SWBM) are generally available on larger vessels for use in port calculations and thus are of limited value when underway.

###### Flow-Through Method

- The flow-through method, whereby tanks are overfilled by pumping in additional water, can be used in weather conditions marginal for the sequential method, as there is little change to the ship's condition.

- Consider other risks and problems when using the flow-through method.

- Research has established that it is necessary to pump in three times the volume of the tank to achieve a 95% change of water. Pumping in only once the volume of the tank produces a 63% exchange; twice the volume produces an 86% exchange, while four times the volume produces a 98% water exchange.

Note: The ship's design parameters consider storm conditions and resulting water on deck. Therefore, even at maximum pumping rates, any accumulation of water on deck will not affect stability.

- After each step, consider the ship’s position, weather forecast, machinery performance, and degree of crew fatigue. If any factors are unfavourable, suspend or halt the ballast exchange.

##### Sediment Removal or Reduction

Ballast tanks sediments shall be managed in accordance with ship’s Ballast Water Management Plan.

- Where practical, clean the ballast tanks to remove sediments as per the plan agreed with the Technical Superintendent or when the Master considers it necessary.

Note: Flushing helps minimize the amount of mud and debris remaining in a tank but is not effective for removing bacteria, plant, and animal organisms.

- Establish a routine for manual cleaning of ballast tanks on a sequential basis to reduce the build-up of sediment.

- Clean tanks when the vessel moves from one trading area to another, if necessary

- Record all actions associated with sediment removal, whether flushing operations or manual removal of sediment build-up, in the Ballast Water Record Book – code G.

To assist in minimizing the risk of transporting and/or discharging unwanted harmful organisms and pathogens:

- Thoroughly rinse anchors and anchor chains when weighing anchor to remove all organisms and sediments at their place of origin.

- Clean chain lockers regularly during sea passages to avoid accumulations of mud and sediment. Keep any mud onboard to be properly disposed of either in mid-ocean or to shore reception facilities.

- Remove fouling organisms from the hull, piping, and tanks regularly and dispose of removed matter in accordance with local, national, and international regulations.

##### Ballast Reporting Form

- The IMO has developed a form for reporting to a national authority that requests information in advance.

- Some countries require using their own form when reporting.

- Pre-format the reporting forms to contain permanent information such as the ship’s name, IMO number, total number of tanks onboard, total ballast capacity, etc.

###### Specific Reporting Requirements

Several countries, ports, and regions have identified procedures / reporting requirements specific to their needs. While these generally follow similar processes, it is essential that the Master and Chief Officer are aware of the requirements for each port and instruct the other officers accordingly.

Special care and reporting procedures may be required in places like California, the Persian Gulf, the Baltic, the Black Sea, China, etc. Known requirements are identified in the ship’s ballast management plan and should be used as briefing notes for specific trading areas.

##### Crew Training & Familiarization

Train all crew involved in the management of ballast water and operation of the BWTS in accordance with the Ballast Water Management Plan requirements.

##### Maintenance of BWTS

Vessels must use the BWTS for any ballasting/deballasting operations unless other local requirements at the next port of destination prevail.

Procedures described in the Ballast Water Management Plan and the BWTS operation booklet must be strictly followed.

BWTS must be strictly maintained and tested according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the company’s Planned Maintenance System (PMS).

Conduct a Risk Assessment (RA) and implement required mitigating measures before any maintenance.

Quality tests of a sample of discharged ballast water must be conducted in accordance with International Maritime Organization (IMO) and Vessel General Permit (VGP) requirements.



### 8.1.8 Equipment and Tests - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Gas Analyzing Equipment

###### Introduction

Detection and measurement of certain gases are important for the safe conduct of vessel operations and for the safety of personnel.

The main requirements are as follows:

Checking safe oxygen levels in enclosed spaces.

Monitoring oxygen content of inert gas.

Measuring hydrocarbon levels for flammability.

Checking for hydrocarbon gas prior to entering Fuel Oil Tanks.

Checking for methane gas concentrations on coal-laden bulk carriers.

Detection and measurement of other toxic gases.

The chief officer, as the designated cargo officer, shall be in charge of the safe and correct operation/calibration of the vessel’s gas measuring equipment.

The chief officer must provide training in the proper use of the equipment to a level suited to the work duties of the person being trained. Records of such training must be maintained.

###### Minimum Stock of Portable Gas Detection Equipment

The regulations (SOLAS regulation XI-1/7 – MSC.1/Circ.1477 and MSC.1/Circ.1485) require all ships engaged in international voyages to carry at least one portable gas detection instrument on board.

Each dry cargo vessel is equipped with two ready-to-use portable gas and oxygen analysers appropriate to the cargoes being carried.

For Reederei Nord, all vessels must carry (at a minimum) the following portable gas detection equipment:

1 (One) instrument with pump and extension hose (approx. 15 meters) capable of measuring and displaying concentrations of:

Oxygen

Flammable gases or vapors (% of LFL)

Carbon monoxide

Hydrogen sulfide

Note: This instrument is for testing the atmosphere in enclosed spaces before entering and for cargo monitoring.

1 (One) instrument diffusion type, capable of measuring and displaying concentrations of:

Oxygen

Flammable gases or vapors (% of LFL)

Carbon monoxide

Hydrogen sulfide

Note: This instrument is for carrying in enclosed space entry during inspection.

1 (One) Portable Pump to be used with chemical testing tubes (e.g., Draeger tubes) and enough chemical testing tubes suitable for the products being carried.

Alco meter

Note: Dry cargo vessels must carry on board chemical testing tubes listed in the Supplement of the Certificate of Compliance for the Carriage of Solid Bulk Cargoes as certain cargoes listed in the IMSBC Code require.

####### Contingencies in Case of Atmospheric Monitoring Equipment Failure

In case of breakdown of monitoring equipment, the company shall arrange delivery of replacement units as soon as possible, either by forwarding available units ready in the office or supplying new units through the agent from the first available supplier.

###### Toxic Gas Detection Analyzers

In cases where poisonous gases are expected due to fumigation or from cargoes not covered by the Multi Gas Detectors, additional tests must be performed with separate pump equipment and respective testing pipes.

The required test tubes will be provided based on the cargo hazards as per the IMSBC Code.

The chief officer should keep an adequate supply of chemical indicator tubes (e.g., Draeger tubes), specific to the cargoes being carried, and ensure they are within their expiry date.

An up-to-date inventory of all gas analyzers and chemical indicator tubes must be maintained.

###### Calibration and Testing of Portable Gas Detection Equipment

Definitions:

Bump Test (Function Check): A qualitative function check where a test or span gas is passed over the sensor(s) at a concentration and exposure time sufficient to activate all alarm indicators to present at least their lower alarm setting. This check confirms that gas can reach the sensor(s) and that all alarms are functional. This check is not intended to measure calibration accuracy.

Calibration Check: A quantitative test using a known traceable concentration of test or span gas to demonstrate that the sensor(s) and alarms respond within the manufacturer’s acceptable limits, typically plus/minus 5-10% of the test gas concentration applied.

Full Calibration: The adjustment of the sensor(s) response to match the desired value compared to a known traceable concentration of test gas. This should be done per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Frequency:

Conduct a calibration check of portable gas monitors when the instrument is prepared for enclosed space entry and cargo monitoring or daily.

Perform a bump test before putting back into service whenever the instrument has been exposed to:

High concentrations of gas

Extreme conditions such as rough handling or physical shock

Over-exposure to concentrations of target gases

Any portable gas monitor that fails a bump test or calibration check must be adjusted by a full calibration procedure before further use or be removed from service.

Conduct a full calibration at least once every year per the manufacturer’s instructions or earlier if specified by the manufacturer.

Note: Service providers must include calibration certificates valid for 12 months. The calibration must not be performed on board. Gas Detectors will be supplied on an exchange basis as follows:

3 Months before the expiry date: Send a request for delivery of gas detectors via Purchasing Software.

Upon receiving the newly calibrated sets and ensuring proper functioning: Return the old set, addressed to the office, with all accessories.

###### Record Keeping

Maintain a TANK 59 - Gas Detectors Inspection record for all portable gas detectors.

####### Disposal of Empty Calibration Gas Canisters

Empty canisters should be safely and appropriately disposed of in compliance with relevant regulations.

If required, they can be landed ashore for safe disposal, though this may incur significant costs in some locations. The cost of disposal should be checked before instruction is given.

On vessels provided with a dedicated canister puncture tool, after ensuring that the canister is completely emptied in a safe area, the tool can be used to puncture it.

This should only be done in a safe, open area. Punctured canisters can then be disposed of as ordinary waste or scrap.

## 8.2 Legal and Commercial - Bulk Carriers



### 8.2.1 Commercial Guidance to Master - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Guidance To Master

###### Introduction

The most important part of any document is that it is properly signed.

Almost all charter party clauses require that documentation be signed by a responsible officer of the vessel and a terminal or charterers’ representative.

Failing to obtain these signatures may invalidate a claim.

Where signatures are not available from a terminal or charterer representative (either because no personnel are available to sign or because they refuse to sign), issue a letter of protest stating “non-availability of terminal rep” or “refused to sign documents.”

###### Delivery and Redelivery of Vessel

The Master must prepare a Certificate of Delivery/Redelivery of the vessel on her entry/exit to/from Charterer’s service using Company form DRY 09 - Re-Delivery Notice.

The Master or Chief Officer must accompany the surveyor carrying out the on-hire and off-hire survey. The Chief Engineer or 2nd Engineer must accompany the surveyor for bunker quantity surveys.

For Time Charter employment, the vessel is delivered with fuel on board to Charterers.

On redelivery, the vessel is delivered with remaining bunkers to Owners, same as on delivery unless different instructions are received from the Operations department.

Note: The Master must ensure that sufficient bunkers are on board, including safety margins.

Keep a record of all details noted by the surveyor. Report to the Operations department if any problems are encountered during the survey.

###### Free Pratique

Free pratique could come from the Port/Terminal/agent.

If unsure whether the vessel has been granted free pratique, contact agents for the time of free pratique and make an entry in the logbook.

Issue a Letter of Protest if free pratique is not received within the specified period, if stated in the C/P.

###### Notice of Readiness

It is vitally important that any requirements to provide ETA notices are complied with completely.

Inaccurate or untimely reporting may cause delays at load or discharge ports, for which the Owners would be held responsible.

All notices sent under Voyage Charter Parties or Sub-Time charters (to Agents, Charterers, Shippers, Receivers, etc.) should be copied to this office using form DRY 10 - Notice of Readiness.

Always tender the Notice of Readiness (NOR) as per the terms of the governing charter party and in the manner and to the parties identified in the charterers’ voyage orders.

Note: There is a clear distinction between Notice of Readiness and Delivery Notice given to Charterers.

Tender the NOR on arrival at the customary anchorage of the load port, provided the vessel is arriving within the specified charter party laycan.

If the vessel arrives at the load port before the charter party laycan, then the vessel is to tender the NOR at the commencement of the laycan, unless the vessel was granted authority by the sub-charterer to tender NOR before the start of the laycan or if early loading was granted.

After arriving and tendering NOR at the customary anchorage (or pilot station if no anchorage is available), if the vessel anchors at some point before the berth to await terminal readiness, then the vessel is to re-tender the NOR without prejudice to the original NOR at the time of anchor down.

If the vessel proceeds directly to the berth from the arrival point or proceeds to the berth after anchoring, then the vessel is to re-tender the NOR without prejudice to the original NOR at the time of all fast.

If the vessel is subject to some form of port state control restriction (e.g., USCG COC inspection), then the vessel is to re-tender the NOR without prejudice to the original NOR at the time the restriction is lifted.

When the vessel is ordered to anchor or drift outside the port, tender the NOR at the time the vessel arrives at the designated area and re-tender at the customary anchorage or upon all fast at the berth. If you are unsure whether your original tender may be valid, always re-tender noting “This notice of readiness is tendered without prejudice to any notice previously tendered.”

If there is any doubt as to when to tender the notice of readiness, please contact the operator as soon as possible.

###### Tendering Notice of Readiness at Multiple Ports

Tender the Notice of Readiness at the first load port upon commencement of laydays, or upon arrival, whichever is later, taking into consideration all other tendering provisions in voyage orders.

After completing loading at the first load port, proceed with utmost dispatch to the next load port. It is imperative that a Notice of Readiness is tendered upon arrival at each load and discharge port.

###### Statement of Fact

From the time of the vessel’s arrival at the load port until the time of departure, one of the most important records to be kept is the Statement of Facts (SOF).

The SOF details all relevant timings of the port call. Many of the detailed times recorded on the SOF will determine which periods of time are for the charterer’s account and which are for the owner’s account.

Note: Accurately completed Statements of Facts will often assist the company in dealing with disputes with other parties.

The first important timing is the tendering of the notice of readiness, which triggers the commencement of laytime.

The Statement of Facts must be completed in local time. The second event that typically occurs is either the time of anchor down, if the vessel anchors while proceeding towards the berth, or the time of all fast at the terminal. Both of these timings signal that laytime resumes. In each instance, the vessel shall re-tender the NOR without prejudice to the initial tendering.

Should the vessel not proceed directly to the loading terminal and remain either anchored or drifting, make an entry in the SOF stating that the vessel is awaiting a “Free Berth.”

Caution: Do not use terms such as awaiting pilot, awaiting tide, and awaiting daylight on the master’s SOF while the vessel is actually awaiting a Free Berth, as they are typically erroneously placed on the SOF. Each of these qualifiers are or may be exclusions afforded under the terms of the charter party to deny demurrage to the owner. For this reason, avoid their use.

Once alongside the terminal, specify whether it is the vessel's gangway or the shore gangway that is used; enter the details of the pre-cargo loading operation into the SOF, including timings of cargo surveyor’s activities, arranging ship/shore cargo gear, sampling, pre-discharge conference, etc.

Note: If we use the shore gangway, then time will count as demurrage. However, if we do not specify whether it is a shore/vessel gangway, then time cannot be reclaimed as demurrage.

Details of the actual cargo operations are to follow, including commencement of discharge, terminal stoppages and resumption of cargo operations, completion of cargo operations, shifting pours, cargo trimming, etc.

Double Banking Operations: When your vessel is involved in a DB operation, ensure the SOF reflects the timing details of fenders off and both vessels separating.

Cargo Quantity Discrepancies: Any cargo quantity discrepancy, including amounts, must be inserted in the SOF. As a general bulker practice, the following are recommended to be inserted:

- All cargo discharged/loaded in sound condition and according to the B/L and Cargo Manifest.

- All cargo holds are completely empty.

- No cargo operation stoppages and/or delays occurred on the ship's account.

- At the loading port, the cargo quantity was determined by shore scale (if applicable).

Shippers/agents may include in SOF the weather at berth while the vessel is waiting for a free berth at anchorage. Clause the entry as follows: "For receipt only. Whilst vessel at anchorage, weather conditions prevailing alongside at berth and effect (if any) on cargo operations are unknown to master/vessel."

###### Mate’s Receipt

A Mate’s Receipt is issued when goods are placed on board the ship after verification of quantity and condition. While it is not a legal requirement, it serves as a procedural convenience.

##### Bills of Lading

The normal practice is for the Bill of Lading (B/L) to be signed by the Master prior to departure from the load berth or port.

As a legal document, it is crucial that all information on the B/L is completely accurate. The B/L is a separate contract from the voyage charter party. The Master must ensure that this important document truly reflects the condition and quantity of the cargo.

Agents should provide shippers/charterers with B/L requirements before loading to confirm accordance with the voyage instructions and submit to the Operations department for approval.

Checks when signing Bills of Lading:

- B/L number: Sign and report the correct number of original bills of lading signed (e.g., 3/3).

- Name of vessel

- Name of Master

- Type/quantity of cargo

- Load/discharge port

- Consignee/Consignor/Notifying party/other parties

- Charter Party date

Quantity of Cargo: The cargo quantity stated on the B/L must match the signed Mate's Receipt.

Note: The Master is not obliged to sign a B/L for particulars he suspects are incorrect or if he has had no reasonable means of checking them.

- Do not sign a B/L acknowledging receipt of goods not loaded.

- If the B/L figure differs from the ship’s figure by more than 0.2%, query the accuracy of the B/L figure.

- If the discrepancy between ship and B/L figures exceeds 0.5%, establish the reason for the difference. If not possible, adopt one of the following:

- Delete the B/L figure and insert the ship’s figure, initialing the alteration.

- Endorse the B/L with the reservation “x tons in dispute.”

- Refuse to sign it, passing it to the agents with appropriate instructions in writing.

- Advise the Operations Manager immediately and contact the local P&I correspondent.

- If the B/L figure is within 0.2% less than the ship’s figure, it is likely in order to sign. If the B/L figure exceeds the ship’s figure by more than 0.1%, issue a letter of protest to Charterers and Shippers, and notify us of the action taken.

Payment of Freight: A B/L without reference to freight being paid is a receipt for cargo only. A B/L marked “Freight Paid” or “Freight Prepaid” may constitute a receipt for both cargo and freight money. Request instructions from the Operations Department and Time Charterers (not Voyage Charterers) if such remarks should be included.

Clean B/L: If charterers require the B/L to be marked 'clean on board,' stop the loading operation immediately if impurities are found that would affect cargo quality. Contact the Operations Department immediately if in doubt. Unclean cargo must be removed and substituted by clean cargo. Notify all parties immediately and call in the owners' local P&I surveyor for assistance. Do not resume loading until receiving clear instructions from the P&I surveyor and charterers via the Operations Department.

Note: If in doubt about the clausing of the B/L, contact this office for clarification.

The Master should ensure the B/L incorporates:

- Paramount clause

- Both to blame collision clause

- Hague rules or Hague Visby rules

- York-Antwerp rules

- New Jason clause

Alternatively, include the following wording in the B/L:

    - “All terms, clauses, conditions and warranties including the arbitration, choice of law, time bar, and time limitation clauses of the charterparty dated ... are hereby incorporated into this bill of lading.”

    - “One original bill of lading must be surrendered duly endorsed in exchange for the goods or delivery order.”

If either the C/P date or the above clauses are not incorporated in the B/L, the Master shall tender a Letter of Protest.

Note 1: Any letter of protest issued by the vessel against the shipper(s)/terminal(s) regarding the bill(s) of lading has no legal effect/value against third parties (i.e., Receivers). The vessel is bound to deliver the quantity and quality of cargo at the discharging port(s) as described in the bill(s) of lading marked ‘clean on board.’ Such cases could result in large claims.

Note 2: The bill of lading legally proves that the cargo has been placed onboard the vessel in the custody of the owner. It is also a financial and negotiation tool. A bill of lading would be rendered without value and un-negotiable in case of remarks by the Master. Financial institutions/banks may not accept a claused B/L as a financial guarantee.

Note 3: Claims related to “clean on board” bill(s) of lading and letters of protest or letters of indemnity, when used, are not covered by P&I, being illegal, and result in direct expense for the owners.

Caution: Do not sign an inaccurate bill of lading or authorize anybody else to do so.

The vessel shall not carry an original Bill of Lading onboard from load port to discharge port unless all the original Bills of Lading(s) issued are marked with the following wording:

“One original Bill of Lading retained on board against which Bill of Lading delivery of cargo may properly be made on instructions received from shippers/charterers.”

Where such a bill of lading is presented, it is important that the Master follows the procedures as advised by the operations department.

If contradictory instructions are received from the commercial operator, the Master shall refer the matter to the operations department for further advice.

In case the Charterer wishes to change the originally issued B/Ls after they were signed:

- The re-issuance of the B/Ls shall be approved by the Owners.

Note: Only one set of bills of lading can be in circulation for any one particular loaded cargo.

- Caution: Do not make any changes in the bills of lading without confirmation from the operations department.

- The Master shall obtain written confirmation from the operations department that all the originally signed bills of lading are in the owner’s/manager’s possession and destroyed.

- The Master may then sight and approve the new document(s) before issuing a letter of authorization to the agent to sign a new set of bills of lading on his behalf.

Contact the operations department for instructions prior to signing the bills of lading if:

- The discharge port stated in the bills of lading conflicts with the voyage orders.

- The orders received from the vessel’s commercial operators (if any) contradict the owner’s instructions.

Warning:

Do not sign a blank bill of lading.

Do not commence discharge unless you have received a duly endorsed original bill of lading or alternatively instructions from your head owners to release the cargo against a letter of indemnity.

###### Electronic Bill of Lading (eBL)

BIMCO’s eBL clause needs to be incorporated into charter parties if the parties intend for charterers to have the right to order owners to issue eBLs.

Carriage of cargo under electronic (paperless) systems is now covered by P&I Clubs, provided that the system has been approved by the International Group of P&I Clubs (IG). Systems administered by Bolero International Ltd (Bolero) and Electronic Shipping Solutions (essDOCS) are currently approved by the IG.

The eBL is created on the system, uploaded, and sent in draft form for approval between the shipper and carrier.

The eBL can incorporate a charter party or other external terms. Once agreed, the carrier issues the eBL, which is then sent by the system to the next party in the chain (e.g., shipper).

The eBL can also be passed back and forth between holders if, for example, amendments to the document need to be made. Like a paper B/L, there can only be one holder of an eBL at any time.

Both systems rely on the principle of attornment to enable the new holder of the eBL to obtain title in the goods.

Each time the eBL is transferred, the system generates an automatic notice from the carrier to the new holder of the eBL, confirming that the goods are now held to the new holder’s order. Both systems have procedures for switching the eBL to a paper B/L at any point in the transaction.

###### Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC)

US Customs requires all Bills of Lading (B/Ls), cargo manifests, cargo declarations, and other documents for shipments entering the USA to have a unique SCAC. Vessel Owners/Operators must have an official SCAC for all vessels trading in the USA. Refer to the Charter Party (C/P) to determine the appropriate SCAC. Each B/L identifier must be a combination of alphabetical and numerical characters, not exceeding 16 characters. This applies to each set of bills; if three originals are required for a parcel, each will have the same identifier.

###### Letter of Indemnity (LOI)

An LOI is a promise by Time Charterers to indemnify Shipowners against any liability, loss, or damage from complying with their requests. LOIs are typically requested in the following scenarios:

- Delivery of cargo without the original B/L

- Change of destination/Deviation

Usually, an original B/L is unavailable at the discharge port, so cargo is discharged against an LOI. The charterer sends the LOI to the office for review or forwards it to the head owner for approval.

Once approved, the Operations department will confirm that cargo can be discharged.

Some charter parties include an LOI invocation clause, integrating the LOI into the charter party without needing a formal LOI.

###### Letter of Authority (LoA) to Sign B/L

If the Master cannot sign the Bills of Lading before departure, issue a Letter of Authority (LoA) to authorize signing on the Master’s behalf.

Address the LoA to “Time Charterers (Company Name) and/or Their Nominated Agents.”

Use the Owner’s format (form DRY 21 - Authorization Letter to Sign Bill of Lading). State that the B/Ls must strictly conform to the Mate’s Receipt and have the owner’s final confirmation.

###### Deadfreight

Dead Freight refers to the situation where a shipper fails to fill the cargo space they have booked on a vessel.

The Master must declare the loadable quantity in writing before loading to establish grounds for Deadfreight if charterers fail to provide the requested cargo.

Note: Use form DRY 23 - Deadfreight Letter.

Most charter parties specify a range of tonnage that the vessel must load, allowing the Master to determine the exact quantity within this range.

The declaration should be in writing, included in the ship/shore information exchange sheet (“LOADING INSTRUCTIONS”), and noted in the notice of readiness. Without this, charterers might avoid responsibility for deadfreight if they fail to provide a full cargo.

For deadweight cargoes, state a minimum quantity up to the full cargo limit. For capacity cargoes, declare a maximum quantity based on an approximate Stowage Factor (SF) provided by shippers, with adjustments when the accurate SF is known. File a final cargo declaration when the accurate SF is known.

Example: “MINIMUM ...x... MTONS UP TO FULL CARGO ...y... MTONS BASED ON APPROXIMATE CARGO STOWAGE FACTOR OF ...... MAXIMUM CARGO QUANTITY OF ...y... MTONS IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT WHEN ACCURATE CARGO STOWAGE FACTOR IS KNOWN TO THE VESSEL.”

###### Cautionary Notes

SCAC: Ensure each B/L, cargo manifest, and other documents include the unique identifier code per US Customs requirements.

LOI: Do not discharge cargo without an approved LOI if the original B/L is unavailable.

LoA: Issue LoA only if the Master cannot sign the B/Ls before departure. Ensure B/Ls conform strictly with the Mate’s Receipt and have the owner's final confirmation.

Deadfreight: The Master’s declaration of loadable quantity becomes contractual once declared. Properly document and communicate the loadable quantity to avoid disputes and ensure charterers provide the required cargo.

General:

- Do not sign inaccurate B/Ls or authorize others to do so.

- Do not commence discharge without a duly endorsed original B/L or instructions from head owners to release the cargo against a letter of indemnity.

- Follow procedures for handling and signing electronic Bills of Lading (eBL) as per approved systems like Bolero and essDOCS.

##### Stevedore Damages

Damage reports must be handled per charter party (C/P) requirements, which means reporting to Stevedores/Charterers/Agents immediately after occurrence with a copy to the Operations Department. For damages affecting seaworthiness, cargo worthiness, or safety regulations, notify the Office immediately as per the communication matrix.

Procedure for Stevedores Damage Reports

The Chief Officer and OOW shall follow this procedure

The Duty Officer shall:

- Immediately inform the stevedore foreman.

- Inform the Chief Officer or Master.

- Witness the inspection of the damage.

- Sign the damage report as a witness.

The Chief Officer or Master shall:

- Inspect the damage with the stevedore foreman and agree on the extent of it.

- Take photographs of the damage.

- Complete the Stevedore Damage Report, form DRY 25 - Stevedore Damage Report.

- Communicate full details of the damage to the company and liaise with the Technical Superintendent for the provision of a shore workshop to assess and repair the damage.

Provide the following details to the company:

- The exact location and dimensions of any structural damage.

- Details of any equipment damaged.

- Any damage to fuel or water tanks.

- Any damage to electrical equipment or cabling.

- Any damage to insulation.

Attach the following to the Stevedore Damage Report:

- Ensure the Duty Officer signs the damage report as a witness.

- Obtain the signature of a responsible party (stevedores, Agents) if possible.

- Ensure the Stevedore Damage Report is signed by at least two persons.

Note: If the stevedore foreman or other shore representative refuses to sign, record this on the form.

Send the completed report within 24 hours to:

- The company.

- The charterer.

- The charterer’s agent.

- The stevedore foreman.

Note: Attach supporting documents and photographs.

In cooperation with the Technical Superintendent/MSI, assess whether:

- The damage will be repaired by the stevedore company or their sub-contractors.

- It is necessary to arrange for a shore workshop to assess and repair the damage.

- The damage can be satisfactorily repaired by the crew.

For damage requiring class or shore facility intervention: If there is any doubt about the vessel’s seaworthiness, inform the company immediately. The company will decide whether class attendance is required and arrange it.

For damage that can be repaired by the vessel: Provide the following information to the company:

- Estimated materials required to repair the damage.

- Estimated man-hours required to repair the damage.

After the damage has been repaired, state and close the Stevedore Damage Report and include all available repair reports and class statements. Forward these to the Technical Superintendent/MSI.

    - Completed

##### Double Banking

From a legal and operational perspective, double banking is similar to ship-to-ship (STS) transfer due to risks such as vessel damage. Review the charter party before conducting double banking operations. Double banking may fall under a “Ship to Ship Transfers” clause if it involves a transfer between vessels.

Note: If double banking operations are not covered in a charter party, it may be unclear who is responsible for any issues.

Master’s Role: Double banking clauses usually require the Master’s approval, but this does not give the Master an absolute right to refuse these operations.

STS Service Providers and Letters of Indemnity

The charter party clause should place responsibility for the STS operation on the charterer, who usually contracts with STS Service providers.

STS Service providers often ask the Master to sign a letter of indemnity, stating that the vessel’s owners take all liabilities arising from the STS operation. Masters should avoid signing these letters.

- If commercial pressure requires signing, ensure:

- Received charterer’s instructions and authority to sign on their behalf.

- Seek advice from the Operations department.

If there is no time to get instructions from the charterers, sign the letter “for receipt only” and immediately inform the charterers that the LOI has

Note: if the vessel is ordered to conduct such operation obtain advice from the Operations department.

##### Off-Hires/Deviation

Inform the Operations department immediately in a separate message if any of the following occur:

- Major deviation.

- PSC issues.

- Stevedore damages.

- Any technical issue that could affect/restrict vessel performance in terms of speed/consumption, loading/discharging capacity.

- Delays due to engine trouble, equipment breakdown, deviation for sickness or stores, repairs or damage.

- Delays in ETA of more than 12 hours due to weather conditions.

If the vessel deviates for any reason, send a complete deviation report to the Operations department at the first opportunity, including time lost, extra distance covered, fuel consumed, etc. Use the following template:

Times are in UTC:

Off-hire commenced	:	Date / Time	FO	DO

Off-hire completed 	:	Date / Time	FO	DO

Off-hire used 	:	             Hours.	            FO	DO

Explanation: Reason for off-hire.

In addition to SOF.

Disruption or delay in loading or discharging should be mentioned in the Port Log / SOF and issue a corresponding Letter of Protest (LOP) indicating which party caused delay, “ship” or “shore.”

###### Weather Routing / Performance Evaluation

Charterers typically provide weather routing advice through a service supplier, based on the Charter Party (C/P) terms with Owners. The vessel’s capability is described in terms of steaming fully laden and/or in ballast at a specified speed and consumption.

There are two main types of weather services provided by routing companies:

- Optimum Ship Routing: Developing the best route based on current weather forecasts, ship characteristics, and special cargo requirements.

- Vessel Performance Monitoring: Assessing the vessel's performance based on described capabilities.

Procedures:

- Provide necessary information to the weather routing company to perform their services.

- Discuss the Master’s intended route with the routing company to determine the most ideal and cost/fuel-efficient route.

- The Master retains the final decision on the vessel's safe navigation. If the Master decides not to follow the recommended route or needs to deviate from the agreed route, they must inform the operations department, the weather routing company, and charterers, including an explanation for the deviation.

- Notify the operations department if the vessel cannot proceed at the ordered speed or any other speed specified in the Time Charter Party (TCD).

- Deviation from the recommended route should be approached with caution due to the fine line between a Master’s navigational responsibilities and the obligation to follow employment instructions.

###### Berth Letters

Loading terminals may tender letters imposing charges on the vessel for delays often beyond crew control. It is strongly recommended not to sign such letters. While charterers under the C/P may put the vessel off hire for the lost period, the vessel should not pay terminal fees.

In such situations:

- Notify the operations department immediately.

- Prepare a Letter of Protest (LOP) to the charterers.

Note: Signing such a letter creates a direct contract between the vessel/her owners and the terminal.

Upon discussion with the operations department, endorse the letter as follows: “FOR RECEIVED ONLY AND WITHOUT AUTHORITY TO BIND THE OWNER OF THE VESSEL”

General Guidance: Double-check all documents before signing and always keep a copy on board.

##### Reference / Records / Forms

### 8.2.2 Letters of Protest and Notes of Protest - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Letters of Protest

###### Introduction

Cargo contaminations/shortages, operational failures/delays, and contractual disputes may result in substantial claims to owners. Alert owners promptly and arrange legal assistance, and P&I attendance to mitigate the risk.

It may take months before the owner is alerted of a claim from a third party, including charterers, receivers, operators, or terminals. The Master should alert all interested parties, including owners, promptly, and lodge a Letter of Protest (LOP) whenever there is a possibility of any claim.

LOP is always addressed to a named party or person.

An LOP serves the purpose of recording a disagreement with another party concerning some matter over which the recipient has some control and holding the recipient responsible for any legal or financial consequences arising from the subject matter being complained about.

In some port state jurisdictions, a Letter of Protest requires to be sworn before a court of law or a notary public. If this situation arises, the Master is to contact this office and/or local P&I.

Below are examples of when letters of protest should be issued. Feel free to issue additional protests if circumstances require it.

The company has provided a set of standard LOP templates to assist the Master. If the Master receives an LOP, alert the office and sign “for receipt only, without prejudice or admission of liability.”

###### Letters of Protest Guidelines

The Master shall protect the owner’s interests when considered necessary by protesting for:

####### Loading Port

Master shall issue an LOP for:

- Late acceptance of NOR

- Unsafe berth

- Delays to vessel

Note: If the vessel is delayed awaiting a berth or the vessel is delayed at the berth for terminal requirements

- Late issuance of free pratique

Note: If free pratique is not granted within 6 hours after tendering NOR, the Master must issue a notice of protest (NOP) to the port authority and the terminal.

- Quality of cargo

- Ship/shore difference in quantity

Note: Issue protest for any difference, however small. If there is a difference of more than 0.50 percent, or as otherwise instructed, between ship and shore final gross figures, the Master must:

          - a) Ask the terminal to re-check and confirm their calculations

          - b) Instruct the chief officer to re-check the ship's figures

          - c) If these checks confirm the ship/shore difference, the Master shall contact the operator for instructions

- Cargo temperature – high (wood pellets, Coal)

- Shore stoppages

- Slow loading rate

- Short loading or overloading by shore

Note: If the agreed cargo nomination was not supplied in full, or was significantly exceeded on a shore stop

- Excessive time waiting for delivery of cargo documentation

Note: When the vessel's departure is delayed for terminal requirements after leaving the berth (usually to await the delivery of cargo documents)

- Non-compliance with charterer’s B/Lading details

- Not incorporating Paramount Clause, Both to Blame Collision Clause, Hague Rules or Hague Visby Rules, York Antwerp Rules, New Jason Clause on B/L or not including Arbitration Clause and C/P terms and conditions with C/P date on B/L

Note: Refer to IMS Ch. 8.2.1 - Commercial Guidance to Master – Bills of Lading

- Dead freight

- Failure to insert SCAC code for cargoes destined for US ports

Note: For good order, it is best if the assigned code is included on the actual B/L; however, it is not required by U.S. customs. The requirement is that each B/L must be assigned a code. This can be assigned after loading but must be reported to U.S. Customs at least 24 hours prior to arrival at the discharge port.

- Refusal to sign vessel's documents

- In case the terminal issues a letter of protest against the vessel, the Master is responsible for being only the physical recipient and should return an acknowledgment “for receipt only, without prejudice or admission of liability”.

- The follow-up actions depend on the nature of the protest.

- Berth rendering arrangements are inadequate

- Shore workers misusing ship’s equipment and ignoring duty officers’ advice

- Cargo not loaded in satisfactory condition

- Any delay caused

Inform the company immediately for further advice and guidance.

####### Discharge Port

Master shall issue an LOP for:

- Late acceptance of NOR

- Delays to vessel

- Late issuance of free pratique

- Shore restrictions – unloading rate

- Shore stoppages

- Ship/shore difference in out-turn quantity

Note: Do not sign any confirmation on outturn figures

- Failure to provide discharge certificate / cargo receipt

###### Note of Protest

A Note of Protest (NOP) is a solemn declaration made on oath by a Ship Master that circumstances beyond his control have or may have given rise to loss and/or damage to his ship or its cargo or have caused him to take action which may render owners liable to legal action by another party.

Generally addressed as “To Whomsoever It May Concern,” an NOP must be made before a notary public, magistrate, consular officer, or other authority.

Issue an NOP when:

- Whenever during the voyage, the ship encountered conditions of wind and sea which may result in damage to cargo.

- When, for any cause, the ship is damaged, or there is reason to fear that damage may be sustained.

- When through stress of weather it has not been practicable to adopt normal precautions in the matter of ventilation of perishable cargo.

- When cargo is shipped in such condition that it is likely to suffer deterioration during the voyage. In this case, however, the protest will not be effective unless the bills of lading were endorsed to show the condition of the cargo at the time of shipment.

- When any serious breach of C/P terms is committed by the charterer or his agent, such as refusal to load, unduly delaying loading, loading improper cargo, refusal to pay demurrage, refusal to accept B's/L in the form signed by the Master, etc.

- When consignees fail to discharge cargo or take delivery thereof, and pay freight in accordance with C/P or B/L terms.

- In all cases of general average.

Protests should be noted as soon as possible, certainly within 24 hours of arrival in port, and in the case of cargo protests before removing a cargo wholly or in part. There is no provision for the signature of the recipient.

Supporting documents required for NOP:

- Deck Logbook pages

- Official Logbook pages

- Weather Reports

- Any Picture Evidence

Extended Protest: At the time of noting the protest, the Master should reserve the right to extend it. Since it is impossible to ascertain the full extent of a loss or damage at the time of noting the protest, an extended protest should be made when relevant facts have come to light.



### 8.2.3 Cargo Shortage and Damage Claims - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Cargo Shortage and Damage Claims

###### Introduction

Most cargo loss or damage claims can be prevented through proper maintenance of vessels and careful handling of cargo. If a vessel causes loss or damage to cargo and carriers are held liable, carriers must compensate cargo interests for their damages.

###### Cargo Shortages

Bulk cargo frequently confronts shortage claims due to:

- Incorrect information on the Bill of Lading

- Spillage during discharge

- Errors in bulk measurement, such as:

- Incorrectly performed draft surveys

- Incorrect shore measurements

- Use of different measuring methods upon loading and discharge

Note: The accuracy of a properly performed draft survey is generally up to ±0.5% of the final figure for dry bulk cargoes.

- Errors in bagged or packaged cargo, such as:

- Incorrect tally work during loading or discharge

- Spillage due to damaged/substandard bags

General load port recommendations:

- Ensure the weight established by the vessel is inserted in the Bill of Lading, or the Bill of Lading contains an appropriate remark such as: “Weight established by Shippers figures only, not confirmed by the Carrier” or “Approximate weight only, not confirmed by carrier.”

- Caution: Do not sign separate cargo documents or certificates unless consistent with the weight established by the vessel.

- After loading bulk cargo, seal all holds in the presence of cargo interest representatives and document this in a Hatch Sealing report.

- Appoint an independent tally clerk for cargo loading.

Note: Independent means not a joint venture with the charterer or shipper.

General discharge port recommendations:

- If a shortage is alleged by the receivers, the Master will likely be asked to confirm this allegation by signing a protest letter. Ensure the signature is accompanied by the words: “For receipt only, all cargo discharged as per the bills of lading and terms and conditions of the C/P, all holds empty.”

- Follow the same procedure for removing seals at the discharge port and record it in a Hatch Unsealing report.

Note: Photographing or video recording the breaking of the seals is recommended, preferably with visible date/time recording.

###### Cargo Damages

####### Wet Damage

Wet damage often occurs due to heavy weather and leaking hatch covers, especially when the vessel sails through heavy weather. Poorly maintained cargo hatch covers and sealing systems increase the risk of water damage. Common wet cargo issues include:

- Leaking cross-joints

- Compression bars in poor condition

- Rubber gaskets in poor condition

- Hatch coamings in poor condition

- Leaking transverse packings

- Drain channels in poor condition

- Non-return valves in poor condition

- Cleats in poor condition

- Bilge water remaining in holds

- Rain during loading/discharging

- Dew condensation

- Ingress of ballast water into holds

- Crack of shell plate

####### Contamination

Contamination can occur due to:

- Cargo hold paint not properly dried and cured, contaminating agricultural products with chemical smells.

- Damaged air pipes from bunker tanks leaking fuel and fumes into the hold.

- Remnants of previous cargo.

####### Condensation Damage Claims

Improper ventilation can lead to cargo sweat and damage, particularly if ventilation is not conducted according to the dew point rule, resulting in humid air condensing on contact with the cargo.

####### Physical Damage Claims

Physical damage can result from:

- Poor stowage and/or securing causing cargo shifting

- Cargo collapse

- Damages by stevedores, which must be reported using form DRY 22 - Cargo Damage Report

####### Mitigation of Damage

All possible measures should be taken to mitigate damage, unless such measures would risk the vessel's safety, navigation, or further damage to cargo. Most cargo damage can be prevented by proper maintenance of the vessel and suitable care and handling of cargo.

##### Maintenance of Seaworthiness

Before and at the beginning of the voyage, exercise due diligence to:

- Make the ship seaworthy.

- Properly man, equip, and supply the ship.

- Make holds, reefer chambers, and all other parts of the ship where goods are carried fit and safe for their receipt, carriage, and preservation.

##### Cargo Care

Goods carried must be properly and carefully:

- Loaded

- Handled

- Stowed

- Carried

- Kept

- Cared for

- Discharged

At Loading Port:

### 8.2.4 On-hire & Off-hire Surveys - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### On Hire/Off Hire Surveys & Inspections

###### Introduction

Under the charter party terms, charterers usually appoint both on-hire and off-hire surveyors/inspectors. On-hire surveys are typically stringent and critical, whereas off-hire surveys may overlook or not record items.

###### Responsibilities

Master: Liaise with charterers and the operations department for the survey.

Chief Officer: Accompany and assist the surveyor/inspector during the survey.

Chief Engineer: Accompany the surveyor during the bunker survey.

###### On Hire and Off Hire Survey Options

A) On/Off Hire Condition Survey:

- Visual inspection of vessel holds, main deck, and cargo working areas to identify any damage present before the vessel goes on/off hire.

- A survey report is issued with photographic evidence.

B) On/Off Hire ROB Bunker Survey:

- Bunker survey involves sounding all tanks and correcting for temperature and density, including the consumption of D.O., F.O. to vessel delivery at the pilot station.

C) On/Off Hire Condition and ROB Bunker Survey:

- Combines A & B surveys performed jointly.

###### On Hire and Off Hire Survey Procedures

- The surveyor should attach ‘Notice of Damage or Loss Reports’ to their report, quoting the notice number, date, and port.

- Maintain careful records of any damage or loss caused to the vessel, and ensure notices of damage or loss are correctly completed and filed.

- If new or latent damage is discovered during the survey, complete a ‘Notice of Damage or Loss Report’ and send it to the charterer and the operations department.

- The Master must verify that the survey report is complete and correct.

- If departing or sailing immediately after the survey, instruct the surveyor or agents to forward the report to the vessel's next port of call.

- Upon receiving an on/off hire survey report, the Master should confirm to the operations department if the report is acceptable or not.

- If a charterer decides against appointing a surveyor, notify the operations department. Meanwhile, the Master, Chief Officer, and Chief Engineer should conduct the on/off hire survey themselves.

- Produce a report listing all damages and losses, supported by ‘Notice of Damage or Loss Reports.’

- Note in the deck logbook that the on-hire/off-hire survey was conducted by the ship's staff.

Caution: Ensure all documents are double-checked and maintain clear communication with all relevant parties throughout the process.

Code of Practice for Packing of Cargo Transport Units (CTU Code)

Code of Safe Practice for Cargo Stowage and Securing (CSS Code)

Ensure that the carriage requirements detailed in the IMDG are strictly complied with, as well as the Certificate of Fitness or IMDG Certificate.

Once the voyage orders have been reviewed and found fully acceptable in all respects, the master shall send a confirmatory message to the company and charterers.

###### Orders of a Charterer

Execute all instructions and directions given by a charterer correctly.

It is of utmost importance that all instructions and directions given by a charterer are properly executed and records filed on board.

If, due to special circumstances, written instructions cannot be provided, and the master has to follow verbal orders:

Make an entry in the deck logbook.

Confirm the order in writing.

Request re-confirmation in writing.

Be aware of the required speed and consumption as per T/C description. Any deviation from the guaranteed performance will enable the charterers to claim off hire and overconsumption.

###### Delivery and Redelivery of Vessel

The vessel may be chartered by owners or head charterers for a time charter.

In such cases, ensure that the terms and conditions of the time charter are not contrary to owners’/head charterer’s instructions. Contact the office for clarifications, if required.

The vessel must be delivered and redelivered at the time and condition as per the terms and conditions stated in CP.

Delivery and redelivery notices must be copied to the office stating date, time (LT/UTC), bunker ROB, and status of holds. A list of outstanding stevedore or other damages must be included at the time of redelivery.

Delivery and redelivery notices are not required in voyage charters.

Note: Use form DRY 09 - Re-Delivery Notice.

###### Tendering Notice of Readiness

Tender the notice of readiness strictly as per the relevant clause of the governing charter party and/or instructions.

All notices sent under voyage charter parties or sub-time charter (to agents, charterers, shippers, receivers, etc.) should be copied to the office.

If the master has any concern about the validity of a notice of readiness that he has already tendered, he should re-tender the notice of readiness on any number of occasions in consultation with the operations manager.

Phrase any subsequent notices of readiness as being “without prejudice to preceding notice of readiness served”.

Note: Use form DRY 10 - Notice of Readiness.

###### On and Off Hire Surveys

On/Off Hire surveys are done at the commencement or conclusion of a CP to check the bunker quantity and vessel condition.

The master or the chief officer must always accompany the surveyor and keep photographic evidence of the vessel condition.

For bunker quantity surveys, the chief engineer or 2nd engineer must accompany the surveyor and ensure tank measurements are accurate.

The surveyor should be requested to attach the ‘Notice of Damage or Loss Reports’ to his report and quote the notice number, date, and port in his findings.

A detailed list of all container lashing equipment must form part of the on/off hire survey report. Container lashing equipment should contain both the owner’s and charterer’s equipment and must be part of the delivery/re-delivery certificate. Any container lashing equipment that is damaged must be noted and any ‘Notice of Damage or Loss Report’ should be attached to the survey report.

It is important that the master is aware of the contents of the survey report to verify it as being complete and correct. If the vessel sails immediately after the survey has been completed, instructions should be left with either the surveyor or the charterer's agent to forward the report to the vessel's next port of call.

Whenever an on/off hire survey report is received on board, the master should confirm to the operations department if the report is acceptable or otherwise. If the charterer decides against appointing a surveyor, then the master must immediately contact the operations department and proceed as follows:

The master, chief officer, and chief engineer should conduct an on/off hire survey.

Report listing all damages and losses and supported by ‘Notice of Damage or Loss Reports’.

An entry that the on-hire/off-hire survey was conducted by ship's staff should be made in the deck logbook.

###### Charterer's Obligations

The charterer or his agents shall give the master the necessary information and documentation as required and at the time required under the charter party.

The information shall allow the ship to load, stow, carry, and discharge the intended cargo safely during all stages of the voyage. This information shall allow the vessel to fulfil requirements as per:

International or national regulations

Flag state regulations

Port regulations

Charter party requirements

International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners (INTERCARGO)

Inform the operations department if the charterer or their agents regularly fail to provide proper information to allow the vessel to trade safely and effectively.

Container vessels are normally time chartered to a liner company and employed on a regular service. Charterers are responsible for providing a container stevedoring operation including:

Receipt

Loading

Handling

Stowing

Lashing

Securing

Unlashing

Un-securing

Tallying

Delivery

In case the vessel is not time chartered, obligations and responsibilities will be outlined in the charter party.

###### Vessel Terminal Planner

Charterers/shipping line staff include a vessel planner. His/her role involves duties and commitments such as:

Preparing vessel schedules

Giving instructions to vessels

Ordering the number of gangs and labor

Improving vessel productivity

Monitoring vessel allocation

Increasing vessel utilization

Monitoring vessel operations

Ensuring an efficient and cost-effective operation

They should be aware of:

Different properties of cargo

Preparing stowage plans

Planning crane split for cargo operations

Segregation of dangerous goods

Other requirements as necessary

###### Safe Port

A safe port is a port:

Where a vessel can reach, enter, remain at, and depart from, without any abnormal occurrence or exposure to danger that cannot be avoided by good navigation and seamanship.

Where the vessel can lie safely afloat at all states of the tide (unless it is customary to load or discharge while safely aground and there is an agreement in the CP).

Which is politically and physically safe for the vessel.

Do not hesitate to ask for port information from owners/charterer/agents/office.

Owners are responsible for checking if the port is safe or not. Therefore, the vessel must check this when the port is nominated. If unsure about a port being safe, inform charterers and office giving reasons and seek advice.

###### NAABSA (Not Always Afloat but Safely Aground) Clause

When a NAABSA clause is incorporated in the CP, the vessel may be ordered to a berth where she may not always be afloat.

Charterers are responsible for all damages and consequences should the vessel touch bottom at the berth.

The NAABSA clause applies only when a vessel is moored to a berth, at buoys, or at anchor. Issue a Letter of Protest (LoP) if during the period of charter, the vessel is directed to a port/berth where it is customary to lie safely aground as stipulated in the charter party, to draw attention to the charterer and/or his agent at the port to some facts or incidents that the master believes may affect the performance of the loading/discharging operation or cause damage to the vessel.

Charterers/agents are not obliged to shift the vessel elsewhere for loading in case of grounding

###### Records / Forms

- Charter party

- Employment Instructions Letters

- Vessel Delivery/Redelivery form

- Notice of Readiness (NOR) form

##### Container Carrier Stability

###### Intact Stability

Vessel stability must meet intact stability requirements during all stages of the voyage, adhering to the minimum stability criteria of the International Code on Intact Stability, 2008 (2008 IS CODE) in Part A and Part B, Recommended design criteria for container ships greater than 100m.

Container carrier vessels are required to carry loaded containers stacked on deck. This high cargo weight positioning results in a relatively high, but if carefully managed, still tolerably safe centre of gravity (CoG) and residual stability upon completion of loading.

The actual values of stability, stress, stack weight, and GM should be compared with the permissible values during:

Loading heavy cargoes

Departure

Voyage

Arrival

Extra allowance should be made for:

Expected weather and sea conditions during the voyage

Effect of free surface on stability

Effect of wind on stability

Possibility of encountering storms

Effect of possible ice accretion

A stability condition and printout from the LOADICATOR must be available on the bridge. For longer voyages, calculate the stability condition and review it with the master every three days. Records of all stability calculations must be kept onboard for a minimum of two years.

The chief officer and OOW must also undertake:

Manual stability calculation upon joining the vessel

Stability calculation each time an emergency drill involves an incident that would affect the stability of the ship, e.g., flooding due to grounding or collision

###### Damage Stability

Damage stability criteria vary from ship to ship, and the requirements are given in SOLAS Chapter II-1. It may involve single compartment flooding, multi-compartment flooding, engine room flooding, etc.

Ship’s Specific Damage Stability:

Ensure that the vessel carrying cargo: a) Is operated as per loading conditions specifically approved for the applicable damage stability requirements. b) Has been assessed for compliance using approved damage stability KG/GM limit curves. c) Has an onboard damage stability program acceptable to the administration based on requirements of:

Intact Stability approval required by the Load Line Convention (ILLC) for all vessels after 21st July 1968.

SOLAS 74 amended 20009, Regulation 5-1 of Chapter II-1, Part B-1.

International Code on Intact Stability, 2008 (2008 IS CODE). d) Damage Stability approval required for:

SOLAS Ch II-1, Part B-1, Reg 9.

Load Line Convention (ILLC) for all vessels after 21st July 1968.

To assist with this, consider the following factors/criteria:

Documentation relating to trim

Intact stability onboard

Damage stability onboard

###### Containership Stability Hazards and Avoidance

Containerships and cargo vessels carrying containers on deck face five high-profile stability hazards. These are described below, along with recommended loss prevention measures and further information links.

Mis-declared Weight of Container and Cargo: This hazard has been reduced by SOLAS, Chap. VI, Reg. 2, para. 6 (in force 2016) and IMO’s MSC.1/Circ.1475 Guidelines on VGM of a Container Carrying Cargo. These rules require that before a container can be loaded on board a SOLAS regulated vessel, the shipper must sign and provide a ‘Verified Actual Gross Mass of the Container’ (VGM) certificate to the Master.

Free Surface Effect (FSE): Bunker fuel and ballast tanks being left in a partially full or ‘slack’ condition and not full and pressed up can cause a rise in a ship’s CoG. This hazard must be incorporated into the stability calculation.

The master and chief engineer are required to minimize the number of slack fuel and ballast tanks.

Sudden Rise in Ship’s CoG: Caused by lifting a heavy container, project cargoes, or OOG using a ship’s crane, which instantly transfers the weight and CoG of the container to the top of the crane jib. This will suddenly raise the combined CoG of the ship and her cargo. A sudden and additional rise in the ship’s CoG and a resulting neutral or negative GM can cause a heavy list or even capsize.

The calculation of stability must consider not only a ship’s final departure stability but also her stability during all stages of loading, discharging operations, and the voyage.

Synchronous Rolling: Referred to in the IS Code 2008 as resonant rolling. It is also explained in the IMO’s Revised Guidance to Masters for Avoiding Dangerous Situations in Adverse Weather and Sea Conditions, MSC.1/Circ.1228. As matching ship roll period and wave period resonance develops, the ship will heel over and develop a heavy list. A container carrying vessel may then be heeled even further by wind pressure and swell action to a point of negative instability.

To overcome synchronous rolling:

Lower the ship’s CoG and increase its GM by taking water ballast on board into DB tanks. This will change the vessel’s roll period so that it no longer matches that of the sea and swell.

Alter the ship’s course heading to introduce a yawing effect and change the approaching wave frequencies.

Alter the ship’s speed to defeat ship/wave synchronism.

Parametric Rolling: A combination of ship and wave hydrodynamic forces generates heavy rolling oscillations. Rolling up to an angle of 45º has been experienced (well beyond Class limits of 35º for container securing gear).

####### Verified Gross Mass (VGM)

The SOLAS VGM (Verified Gross Mass) is the declaration of the accurate gross mass of a packed container under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). It requires the overall weight of all containers to be loaded onto a shipping vessel to be declared.

The master and chief officer must ensure that packed containers are accepted only if information on VGM has been provided. The stowage plan based on this information shall be safe for carriage onboard the vessel. This information can be made available by electronic means such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or Electronic Data Processing (EDP).

Inform the operations department and planner if information on VGM is not provided in advance and endeavour to obtain this information.

####### Stack Weight

Stack weight is the maximum weight that can be loaded on top of the deck (tank top) or hatch cover. If stacks are found to exceed the allowable stack weights, inform the terminal planner/central planner to modify the cargo stow plan accordingly.

When containers are loaded on board, they must be stowed in accordance with the permissible stack and tier weight limits set out in the approved Cargo Securing Manual.

Forces acting on the containers and securing equipment, generated by the ship’s rolling and pitching, are greatest in outboard rows and higher tiers.

Avoid loading heavy containers above light containers and at the top of a stack.

Never ignore restrictions placed on individual tiers as indicated in the approved Cargo Securing Manual.

Always refer to the approved Cargo Securing Manual (CSM) to determine the ‘permissible stack weights’, which also considers class rules and dynamic forces acting on containers in a seaway.

Weight per container data provided in the Trim and Stability document is based on the strength of the tank top and does not account for dynamic forces, which ship and cargo are subject to.

####### Stack Height

Container stow must never exceed the stack height restrictions mentioned in the approved loading manuals. Ensure that sufficient hatch cover clearance is available for cargo loaded within the holds, especially when loading High Cube (HC) units under deck.

####### Container Size

Stowage and lashing systems are generally designed for a standard ISO container. When loading non-standardized units, consider the size of the cargo during the planning stage.

####### Metacentric Height (GM)

GM of a ship depends on the weight of the containers on deck and under deck. GM plays a critical role in the determination of lashing plans and lashing forces. Forces acting on containers stowed on deck primarily depend on the vessel’s GM.

The ship’s cargo securing arrangement, as mentioned in the Cargo Securing Manual, is based on maximum GM. When operating at GM values exceeding those in the Cargo Securing Manual, the expected forces acting on containers and lashings increase.

##### Parametric Rolling

Explained in IMO’s Revised Guidance to Masters for Avoiding Dangerous Situations in Adverse Weather and Sea Conditions, MSC.1/Circ.1228.

Parametric rolling describes the phenomenon of large unstable roll motion coupled with significant pitch motions suddenly occurring in head or following seas. Such a phenomenon depends on vessel parameters like very fine bow lines together with very wide and full stern contours. It is more pronounced when the pitching period is either ‘equal to’ or ‘half’ of the vessel’s rolling period.

Conditions Causing Parametric Rolling:

Vessel is heading into head seas or fine on the bow.

Wavelength is equal to the length of the vessel.

Wave encounter period is half of the natural rolling period (vessel pitching twice in one roll period).

Wave height exceeds a critical level.

Roll damping is low.

Parametric rolling is worse when a ship is operating at reduced speed in adverse sea conditions. Such conditions can cause containers to be lost overboard due to broken deck lashings.

IMO guidelines suggest that parametric rolling is particularly dangerous when the wavelength is 1.0 to 1.5 times the vessel’s length. Parametric rolling is more pronounced on container vessels due to their bow flare and the transom stern extending to almost full breadth.

To reduce parametric rolling:

Use water ballast to alter the GMT and hence the natural rolling period to a non-synchronous value.

If fitted, use an anti-rolling stabilizing system. Anti-rolling stability tanks that transfer water across the ship or vertically between two tanks are effective for all ship speeds. A quick response time is vital to counteract this type of rolling.

Alter the ship’s speed.

Alter the ship’s course.

If in any doubt that the vessel is taking unexplained rolls with increasing amplitude, alter course broadly, even up to 90 degrees, to break the roll cycle.

Use weather routing to identify adverse weather conditions in advance and take avoidance actions accordingly.

Avoid sailing in conditions when the vessel is pitching twice during each roll period.

Avoid a wave encounter period to rolling period ratio of 1:2.

####### Flume Tanks (Passive Roll Stabilization Tanks)

Flume tanks are designed to reduce the roll amplitude. If flume tanks are to be used on passage, the final GM must be calculated having due allowance for flume tank content and free surface effect. Flume stabilization tanks should be emptied or pressed up on arrival in port.

###### Vessel Stresses and Load Distribution

The Chief Officer must closely monitor and coordinate with the Planners for optimization of pre-stowage to minimize stresses.

Allowances should be made for changes in trim and draft due to the change in water density. This is of extreme importance in calculating arrival drafts for ports:

Where under keel clearances are critical

Where compliance with stipulated even keel arrival drafts is strictly enforced

In case of any doubt regarding vessel stability conditions, take immediate action and inform the Operations department for further assistance.

Under no circumstances shall shearing forces, torsion, and bending moments exceed 100%. Monitor shearing forces, torsional forces, and bending moments at every stage of loading, sailing, and discharging operations.

###### Visibility Criteria

Container stowage shall ensure the vessel meets the visibility requirements specified in SOLAS Chapter V / Regulation 22 at all times during the voyage.

Check and comply with local regulations while planning cargo/ballast on board, e.g., visibility criteria for Panama Canal transit.

####### Lashing Forces

During sea passage, container frames, ship’s fixed fittings, and portable lashing fittings are subject to varied dynamic loads.

‘Lashing Force’ is the sum of all such forces acting on a container unit.

Calculation of lashing forces is generally included as a module in the Class-approved loading computer. These forces include:

Racking Force + Corner Shear + Compressive Force + Separation Force + Lashing Tension + Acceleration Forces + Tipping Forces

Lashing forces are the sum of above forces

The angle of roll is normally the most critical. The natural period of roll can be determined using the formula:

TR= (0.7 x B)/(GMT)⁰˙⁵ sec approx.

B = breadth molded of the ship.

The Cargo Securing Manual contains parameters of lashing plans. Ensure the stow plan considers the forces acting on the lashing equipment.

When calculating lashing forces, use maximum speed, maximum GM during the voyage, and the current draft of the vessel. If lashing forces are exceeded, consider amending the stow plans or ballast condition of the vessel to ensure forces are within permissible limits throughout the voyage.

Apply lashings in accordance with the approved Cargo Securing Manual. Consider additional lashings if expecting bad weather. In bad weather, manoeuvre the vessel to minimize motion and avoid exceeding the parameters.

##### Typical Stability Information Onboard

###### Stability Information Booklet (SIB) – Standard Loading Conditions

The stability information booklet includes loading cases approved with reference to intact stability, damage stability (where applicable), and strength requirements. Damage stability information may also be included in a separate booklet; however, the SIB is the primary document and covers both intact and damage stability (where applicable).

###### Stability Information Booklet (SIB) – Allowable Limit Curves

The SIB will often include KGmax or GMmin limit curves that allow the master to evaluate stability for a range of conditions. However, these may be for intact stability only.

####### Stability Loading Program (i.e., Loading Instrument)

Software undertakes longitudinal strength and stability calculations for any loading condition. The software may or may not verify damage stability compliance.

The presence of damage stability capability can be confirmed if the program or user manual references SOLAS Code or if the program has a damage stability option. Verify the Marine Design Appraisal Document for the software capabilities.

###### Stability Information Requirements

The master shall ensure the following:

The ship's master should provide a SIB approved or provisionally approved (for new ships or ships which have recently changed flag) by the classification society on behalf of the flag. This can be demonstrated by the presence of an approval statement on the first few pages of the SIB.

The SIB should be in the working language of the ship or at least in English. The master should be able to demonstrate his understanding of the SIB in the language written.

Where required by SOLAS, the vessel should have evidence of damage stability approval for all the loading conditions included in the SIB. A useful indication that the SIB has been assessed for damage stability is that the SIB is stamped as complying with SOLAS.

Loading conditions that are not significantly different from existing approved loading conditions may be considered acceptable.

###### Stability Guidance on Deviation from Loading Manual

The loading conditions stated in the stability booklet were prepared to illustrate the features of the vessel, representing the whole range of operation and their compliance with regulations required for the ship. These include:

Freeboard

Longitudinal strength

Intact and damage stability criteria

A loading case that differs from those in the Loading Manual must be investigated to ensure these criteria are met. This can be done with the aid of a loading computer with reliable results. The loading software and test loading conditions must be Class Approved.

In case deviation is required due to trade or cargo requirements, inform the operations department to arrange Class and Flag state approval. Include the following documents in the request:

Risk Assessment

Load Computer printouts

Any other relevant information: Operations requirements, requests from Charterers, etc.

###### Arrival/Departure Sailing Condition

Where the ship is not loaded as per an approved condition in the SIB, it is acceptable if written authority from the flag/class has been obtained stating that this alternative loading condition is satisfactory.

This will normally be in the form of printed loading conditions, in addition to those included in the SIB. The additional loading conditions must be accompanied by an approval statement.

Assessing alternate loading conditions by referring to critical damage KGf or GMf data in the approved SIB would be an acceptable alternative. The limiting KGf or GMf limits should be clearly presented with sufficient guidance to ensure they are correctly applied.

The presence of damage stability capability can be confirmed if the program or user manual references SOLAS/International Convention of Load Line or if the program has a damage stability option.

###### Stability when Dry Docking

Prior to entering dry docks, a complete stability calculation must be undertaken. Details of the calculation must be given to the dock master before entering the dock. A full set of soundings and tank readings must be taken just as the ship takes the blocks.

All ship's staff should be informed that while in dry docks, loading, discharging, or moving weights greater than 1 ton must be reported to the chief officer.

A full stability calculation must be undertaken prior to flooding the dock and include all weights loaded onto or taken off the ship during the docking period.

A full set of soundings must be taken when the dock is being flooded just before floatation, and the stability calculation adjusted as necessary.

##### Cargo Documentation

###### Introduction

File the documentation relating to the cargo and cargo operations sequentially. These documents are important to defend against possible cargo claims.

The chief officer shall maintain files of all cargo documentation.

###### Cargo Documents

The following documents must be available on board before loading, with copies sent to the operations department:

Cargo Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)

Hazardous cargo manifest

Stowage plans with locations of DG cargoes

Based on the characteristics of the cargo, risk assessment and crew awareness and/or training should be carried out. Post the following documents in:

CCR or on cargo notice board

Officers' recreation room

Crew recreation room

Bridge

Engine control room

Fireproof containers with the ship's fire plan (p/s side)

Request the shippers and/or agents for appropriate documents before loading operations start. If not received:

Issue a letter of protest on the matter

Inform the company immediately

###### Cargo Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)

For dangerous goods loaded in bulk, the name of the material, IMO Class and UN Number or BC Number, and MSDS must be available.

###### Dangerous Cargo Manifest

Any dangerous good or material classified as potentially harmful to people, animals, or the environment must be listed on a dangerous cargo manifest to be transported by a cargo vessel.

The manifest must include the correct classification of the hazardous materials, as well as the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) codes and Medical First Aid Guide (MFAG) details.

Dangerous goods are typically stored in a separate area of the vessel and handled with care to avoid accidents. Some examples of hazardous cargo include toxic or corrosive chemicals, compressed gases, radioactive materials, and explosive materials.

####### Cargo Manifests

Cargo Manifest is usually prepared by the agent at the loading port or by the Master while the vessel is en route to the discharge port. It lists the quantity of cargo parcels loaded together with their stowage position. Its purpose is to provide readily available data for customs authorities and agents in the discharge port.

####### Dangerous Cargo Manifest

Stowage of dangerous cargoes must be checked against the IMDG Codes and the vessel’s Document of Compliance for the carriage of dangerous goods, as appropriate.

A detailed list of all dangerous cargoes on board should be always posted on the bridge and in the cargo office for the period that there are dangerous cargoes on board. This list should include:

Proper shipping name, including the technical name, of each dangerous cargo

Quantity of each type of dangerous cargo on board

Net weight (excluding the box)

Port of loading and discharging

Type of packaging

The primary and subsidiary hazard classes

UN number

Stowage position

No dangerous cargo must be loaded on board without proper transportation documents. These documents must be presented to the vessel for verification before loading commences.

Attach a copy of the standing orders as a preface to the deck orders.

##### Container Operations - General Precautions

Checklists: The Chief Officer shall complete DRY 01 - Pre arrival load disport or any terminal equivalent before starting cargo operations.

Containers Safety – Danger to Personnel: All crew, joining crew, visitors, and superintendents must be aware of dangers passing under containers and while moving in the cargo working areas. Dangers include lashing equipment being released or removed.

Load Lines Zones and Calculations: The "International Convention on Load Lines 1966" places restrictions on ships carrying cargoes to ensure the safety of the ship, cargo, and personnel by keeping a minimum freeboard. The Load Line convention divides the world into different load lines zones. Each vessel is assigned a freeboard based on the load line marks permanently marked on its sides, with details contained on the Load Line Certificate. Do not exceed load line restrictions along the voyage.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Wear appropriate PPE.

Wear high visibility vests when working on deck during cargo operations. Note: Refer to Ch. 7.07 Company Clothing and Protective Equipment.

Safe Access for Cargo Securing Operations

The Master must ensure the familiarization of staff with the Cargo Safe Access Plan (CSAP) and maintenance of all listed arrangements.

Lashing/unlashing operations of deck containers are the most common activities that involve the most injuries to dock workers and crew onboard vessels that occur within container ports.

###### Cargo Safe Access Plan (CSAP)

The Cargo Safe Access Plan (CSAP) is a mandatory document for vessels built after 1st January 2015. It forms part of the vessel's Cargo Securing Manual (CSM) and details arrangements necessary for conducting cargo stowage and securing in a safe manner. This plan, made at the design stage of the vessel, contains details of arrangements on board. Guidelines for the preparation of CSAP are included in Annex 14 of the CSS Code.

###### Safe Lashing and Securing Operations

Remove all loose lashing material from hatch covers before opening/closing.

Tidy loose equipment that is lying on decks, hatch covers, lashing bridges, and coamings.

Never stand or walk under a raised container or Hatch Cover.

When working on the top or side of a container, use safe access equipment and never climb containers.

If working using a ladder, secure the ladder properly.

Take care climbing onto a lashing bridge – there could be loose items of equipment that can fall, or the safety bar could be across the opening.

Take due care when fixing penguin hooks or lashing rods, as these can slip and strike someone.

Close all openings that are not necessary for operations.

Check and verify that the following means of safe access and movement are in good condition:

Fencing around lashing platforms, especially for outboard container pedestals, which are susceptible to damage.

Walkways and lashing platforms – they should be clear and free of any obstructions.

Inspection and maintenance of cross-deck gratings and lashing platforms on a regular basis.

Access covers to container pedestals and lashing platforms, including the locking arrangement for them.

Mark and highlight the areas as per CSAP, including bay and row numbers.

Collapsible stanchions and/or safety lines are in place around open hatchways and cargo spaces – maintain adequate spares of safety wires and turnbuckles to replace damaged safety lines. Note: Maintain records of all inspection and maintenance for walkways, lashing platforms, ladders, equipment as per CSAP, and lighting in the cargo areas in the PMS.

Maintaining safe access to cargo areas is very important. In some ports, prior to commencing cargo operations, a safety inspector boards the vessel to assess stevedore safety. Stevedores reserve the right to refuse cargo operations if conditions are found unsafe.

Carry out regular training with the staff on precautions to be taken while lashing/unlashing containers, including the vessel’s unique characteristics and handling arrangements.

###### Overriding Key-Operated Alarms

Overriding of safety devices, trips, and alarms during normal operations is NOT allowed. Where an overriding switch is operated by a key, the key must be kept under the control of the Chief Officer. The Master’s permission must be obtained before any safety device or trip is overridden.

###### Deck and Cargo Lighting

Maintain adequate levels of illumination in the cargo areas. Rig portable lights as a temporary measure if unable to repair fixed lights. Check the following:

All lights are operational for safe working during darkness.

Fitted with shade glasses and, if required, protective grills.

Do not hang the lights by their wires – use a separate line.

Cover plug points when not in use.

Areas below side-hatch covers and cross-decks may have inadequate lighting. Limit the movement of personnel to marked walkways during hours of darkness. Crew must carry flashlights, and if necessary, provide portable lights in such areas.

###### Hot Work

Do not carry out any hot work in port without obtaining permission from port authority and Office. If a cargo hold is carrying or has carried flammable/dangerous cargo, confirm the space is safe for performing hot work.

Note: Refer to chapter 5.3.3 Hot Work (dry cargo Vessel) for further guidance.

###### Hazards of a Cargo Hold Atmosphere

Containers loaded in cargo holds of a container ship may contain a hazardous atmosphere when personnel enter the hold due to the following possible reasons:

Leakage of cargo from hazardous cargo units due to poor stowage and packaging.

Leakage of gases from Controlled Atmosphere reefers.

Mis-declared contents in the container, with harmful cargo than described on the manifest.

###### Cargo Hold Entry Precautions

Comply with vessel-specific Cargo Hold Entry Checklist Form DRY 06. Use this checklist for monitoring cargo hold entry on container ships. Avoid entry into cargo holds unless necessary for monitoring the cargo. For other enclosed space entries conditions,

Note: Refer to the procedures in the chapter 5.3.2 - Entry into Enclosed Space.

###### Fire Fighting for Cargo Holds

Possible causes of fire on board containers:

Certain chemicals such as calcium hypochlorite, electronics, batteries, and charcoal are among the dangerous cargos known to ignite inside cargo containers.

Self-heating, combustion, or explosion of dangerous cargoes.

Incompatible materials which may react dangerously.

Shippers’ mis-declaration of hazardous cargo.

Materials liable to spontaneous combustion.

Smoking and the use of naked flames.

Hot work.

Cargo holds have the following means for suppressing a fire in cargo holds:

Fire Hoses Note: Any part of the empty cargo space must be able to be reached by two jets of water from two separate, single lengths of hose.

Fixed Fire Fighting System (CO2)

Seawater sprinkler system for designated Cargo Hold Note: Cargo spaces intended for the carriage of dangerous goods, to protect the cargo, particularly hazardous cargo.

Cargo holds must have fire detection systems in cargo holds as follows:

Fire detection system for cargo holds: Combined smoke extraction and carbon dioxide (CO2) system.

####### Spill Response Equipment

Keep the equipment ready for protecting the vessel and the environment.

For firefighting contingencies, follow IMS Ch. 5 – Safety and Risk Management  and the Emergency manual.

###### Gangway Notices

Display the below items at the gangway:

No-smoking notice

No visitors notice

Security notice

###### Scuppers & Save-alls

Before starting cargo operations:

Plug all deck scuppers.

Plug the save-alls at the bunker manifolds, hydraulic mooring winches, fuel tank air vents, and Hydraulic cylinder oil jacks for Hatch Covers. Note: Test the scupper plugs and save-all plugs for a tight fit.

Drain accumulated water periodically, after approval of the OOW & terminal.

Replace scupper plugs immediately afterward.

The crew member draining water should:

Never leave the location.

Continuously monitor the overboard side.

Immediately close scuppers on sighting any oil sheen or traces in water.

Inform the OOW in case oil traces are observed in the water.

###### Opening/Closing Hatch covers and Cargo Hold Access Hatch

Special attention should be paid to the following items:

####### Lift Away Hatch Covers

Lifting type or lift away type hatch covers are generally used on container ships.

Opening and closing are normally handled using shore cranes or ship’s gear.

Remove the loose lashing equipment placed on top of hatch covers, as it may cause damage to hatch covers and associated fittings.

Note: Ensure all anti-lifting devices, if fitted, are removed prior to opening hatch covers. Engage back prior to loading of containers on hatch cover top.

####### Folding Type Hatch Covers (If fitted)

To ensure trouble-free functioning of the hatch cover, train the crew properly for this task.

No one should be permitted to operate the hatch covers until they have received such training and become fully acquainted with the operating instructions.

The access of unauthorized persons to the stowing area of the hatch covers must be prevented.

There must be a good view over the whole operation area from the control stand.

Note: Check that safe operation is possible without let or hindrance. Use clear channels of communication.

Make sure that there are no persons and no loose gear on the hatch cover panels, which could fall during operation.

Appoint a crewmember to observe the operation from the opposite side and be prepared to stop the operation in case of any hazard, malfunction, or emergency.

Note: If anything unexpected occurs, the operation must be stopped immediately.

If the ship is heeled or trimmed, the operation must be carried out most carefully.

Note: Check the heel/trim restrictions in the Hatch Cover maker's manual.

Operating speed must be reduced when the cover is approaching the open position. Use stoppers to avoid impact damage.

Closing the hatch cover shall be initiated at a slow speed.

Check the proper securing of the panels in the stowed position.

####### Cargo Holds Access Hatches

Access hatches must be properly opened and secured (by locking pin) during cargo operations.

###### Emergency Opening/Closing of Hatch Covers

####### Failure of One Pump

In case of a failure of one pump of the pump unit, the equipment can be operated with the remaining pump at reduced speed.

####### Failure of Pump Unit (Operation with Auxiliary Pump Unit)

In case of a failure of the whole pump unit, the hatch covers can be operated with the MacGregor auxiliary pump unit (A.P.U.)

Note: Follow the Hatch Cover Maker’s manual for Emergency Closing operations and use of the A.P.U.

###### Hold Bilge Sounding

Carry out daily soundings of all cargo holds bilges.

Readings should be recorded in the deck logbook.

The bilge wells need to be clean and well maintained.

The strainers should be clean and freely allow the flow of water.

The sounding pipes need to be operational and:

Not damaged, holed, or obstructed.

Properly marked with CH bilge well number.

Show maximum sounding height as per calibration tables.

Keep in operational condition:

Bilge pumps

Bilge ejectors if installed

Piping system and valves

Ensure officers are familiar with the bilge pumping system.

####### Hold Bilge Alarm System

Accumulated rainwater/water leakage in cargo holds often causes wet damage to cargo.

Test the high-level bilge alarms as per PMS.

CAUTION! Containers are not designed for immersion in water, and accidental flooding affecting containers can result in cargo damage.

####### Actions After Cargo Hold Bilge Alarm Activation

Upon activation of the cargo hold bilge alarm, OOW must:

Notify the Master and Chief Officer at any time, day or night.

Record in the deck logbook.

Follow risk assessment and entry into enclosed space (cargo holds) procedures.

Carry out a visual inspection of the cargo hold bilges.

In case of:

Clear water: Follow the procedure to pump out overboard.

Leaking fuels/lubricants/hydraulic oil/dangerous cargo or any other pollutant: Follow the procedure to transfer to the bilge holding tank.

Note: While in port, restrict pumping out clear water overboard. Keep all in bilge holding tanks.

###### Ship Cargo Gear

Terminal gantry cranes are normally used for cargo operations. In some ports, ship’s cranes are used if fitted.

Generally, stevedores carry out cargo operations under the supervision of ship staff.

####### Use of Vessel Gear for Cargo Operation (If Container Carrier Cargo Geared)

Test all cargo equipment:

At least 24 hours prior to arrival, weather permitting, as per form DRY 32 - Cargo Gear Preparation.

Prior to operations, tender DRY 35A-Crane Letter.

Before handing over to the stevedores.

Ensure markings on all gear are in accordance with the cargo gear register and certificates.

Maintain proper records of certificates for wires and loose gear, e.g., shackles, links, etc.

Note: In Australia, individual components are checked against the certificates.

Duty personnel and the Electrical Officer must provide necessary familiarization training to stevedores in the use of ship’s gear, especially if there are any special precautions required for its use.

CAUTION! Give particular attention during parking/un-parking of ship’s cranes while the shore gantries are operating within the vicinity.

####### Damage to Ship’s Cranes

Should a shore gantry damage a ship’s crane, the master must immediately prohibit its use by taking the following steps:

Secure the crane in as safe a position as possible according to the damage sustained and stop cargo operations in its vicinity if necessary for the safety of the crane.

Disconnect the power supply to the affected crane.

Lock the access door to the crane cab.

Post a notice at the door that the crane is damaged and not to be used until further advised.

Give clear and unambiguous instructions to all ship’s personnel that the crane is not to be used.

Ensure that the stevedores are advised in writing that the crane cannot be used until further notice.

The master and chief engineer must carry out a thorough inspection of the damaged crane to satisfy themselves that it is safe to continue using the crane or if there are any limitations hindering its proper performance.

Request the attendance of a class surveyor to inspect the damages, carry out necessary repairs, test, and certify that the crane is fit for use within its designed parameters.

####### Lashing Equipment/Cargo Securing Equipment

The Chief Officer must routinely inspect and maintain the cargo securing equipment.

Cargo securing equipment includes:

Fixed fittings

Portable lashing material

Maintain records of inspection and maintenance of such equipment with the Cargo Securing Manual. Inspection records are subject to verification by inspectors.

Maintain the certificates of all such equipment in the Cargo Securing Manual.

###### Fixed Fittings

Fixed fittings are lashing components permanently attached to the structure of the ship and bear the load of the entire stack of cargo:

Deck ISO sockets

Lashing plates or pad eyes

D-rings

Dove tail foundations

Fixed stacking cones

Cell guides and entry guides

These fittings are subject to wear and tear. Carry out regular examinations to check for any signs of wear and distortions.

Routine Inspections:

Dovetail foundations: Ensure the clearance is not excessive (should be between 1.5mm and 4mm) and the bottom plate of the dovetail shoe is not thinning down.

Pad eyes: Inspect for corrosion, thinning down, or weakening welding.

ISO sockets: Check routinely for any cracks, excessive wear, and tear. Compare the thickness of the top plates and clearances of ISO sockets with the dimensions included in the Cargo Securing Manual.

Note: Notify the technical department if excessive wear-down is observed or if in doubt about the condition of the ISO socket.

Cell guides and entry guides (Elephant ears): Inspect for excessive wear down and any deformities due to damages. Maintain a running status of damaged cell guides and plan repairs in discussion with the office.

###### Portable Lashing Material

Portable lashing materials are securing equipment that are not permanently attached to the ship:

Turnbuckles

Extension pieces

Twist locks

Stacking cones

Bridge fittings

Cone guides

Ensure that the locking mechanism of twist locks is functioning.

Inspect turnbuckles for corrosion, bent hooks, thinned down hooks, etc.

Only one type of twist lock must be used throughout the vessel, either left-hand locking or right-hand locking. A combination of the two should never be carried on the vessel.

###### Lashing Bins and Lashing Gear Flat Racks

Rough handling by stevedores might cause damage to lashing bins and flat racks.

Inspect them for any structural damage periodically at intervals not exceeding three months.

Note: Inform the office if any damages are found.

Stencil the ship’s name on the flat racks/individual bins for identification and to avoid mixing own ship’s gear with other vessels.

###### Management of Damaged Lashing Material

Remove from service any lashing material found worn out, damaged, or distorted.

Segregate and store the damaged and incompatible lashing equipment in a dedicated bin.

Note: Bins marked ‘Damaged – Not For Use’.

####### Maintenance

Record the maintenance of lashing equipment in the approved record sheets of the container securing manual.

Check and service all lashing equipment every two months.

####### Lashing Gear Inventory

The vessel is responsible for maintaining the quantity of lashing material as per the Cargo Securing Manual.

Complete the inventory as follows:

Monthly as per DRY 27 - Monthly Lashing Gear Inventory and include with the monthly returns.

Quarterly as per DRY 27B - Quarterly Charter Lashing Gear Summary Report for Charterer’s/Owner’s instructions.

Off-hire/On-hire during a new charter.

If suspecting a possible shortfall due to damage/pilferage of lashing material.

Note: The minimum stock of lashing gear to be maintained on board at all times will be as per the approved Cargo Securing Manual with a maximum +/- 5-10% deviation.

Report to the Operations Department and Charterers any damages or losses to lashing gear.

Issue a requisition order (RO) quarterly to replenish missing/damaged lashing equipment and to keep stock as per the Cargo Securing Manual (CSM). Inform the Technical Superintendent and include the Lashing Inventory.

###### Use of Charterer's Lashing and Securing Gear

Some charterers supply their own lashing gear or provide gear when there are special cargoes to be carried.

Unless the charter party makes specific reference to lashing gear, the following guidelines should be used:

Count all items before signing a receipt.

Endorse the receipt with any comments regarding the condition of the gear if necessary.

For gear designed for special cargoes, ensure written instructions are provided on how and when the equipment should be used.

Handle, stow, and maintain the charterer's gear carefully.

If charterer's gear is lost or damaged, follow the same procedure as for the ship's own equipment.

Ensure all equipment supplied by the charterer is accompanied by valid test certificates.

Note: Use of uncertified gear may result in loss of P&I cover if there is damage to the vessel and cargo or injuries to personnel.

Ensure the charterer's gear is taken off the vessel at redelivery against a duly signed receipt. The receipt must state that the gear was returned in "good order fair wear and tear excepted" to avoid any later claims from the charterer.

##### Accommodation Access

Keep all external doors, ports, and windows in the accommodation block closed.

Designate only one door for routine access to and from the exterior deck. Mark this door clearly to avoid misuse. Preferably use the offshore side door for this purpose.

##### Safe Deck Watch

###### Introduction

Do not leave the cargo holds unattended.

The deck watch should normally comprise:

Minimum two deck ratings

OOW (Officer of the Watch)

Chief Officer (at the start, during critical operations, and towards the end of operations)

The deck ratings shall:

Maintain a continuous watch at the cargo holds

Tend to mooring lines

Tend to the accommodation ladder and safety net

Keep watch at the gangway, verify the credentials of all visitors, and maintain the Gangway/Visitors Log & Crew Shore Leave Record Book

Ensure compliance with the vessel's safety regulations

Check visually for pollution and security over the side

Carry out fire and security patrols, recording the Deck Security Patrols

Make safety and security checks around the accommodation

Ensure the correct display of signals and flags

Assist the OOW with cargo work and operations

Note: Assist with taking soundings of Ballast Tanks during ballasting operations

###### Signals

Display the appropriate international and local day and night signals prescribed for cargo handling operations.

##### Handling Emergencies during Voyage

Vessels may encounter several types of emergencies related to cargoes carried, such as:

Leakage of cargo

Shifting of cargo units due to failure of lashings, especially OOG units

Spillage/Fire of Dangerous goods

Water ingress in cargo hold through bilges, manholes of ballast tanks, or other pipelines

Contact the office as per the Emergency Manual upon noticing the above conditions or any unexpected behavior of the vessel.

###### Emergencies Involving Dangerous Goods

Prior to taking any action, refer to the ‘Emergency Schedule’ (EmS) for the cargo in the IMDG Code.

Note: EmS codes assigned to each UN number are a 2-part code starting with letter “F” for fire and letter “S” for spillage. EmS tables are published in the supplement of the IMDG code.

CAUTION: For handling leakages from DG cargo units, ensure staff wears proper PPE (Chemical protective suits, rubber gloves, and SCBA set). Water is not always the best solution for restricting fire on DG cargo units. Do not apply water to cargoes that are reactive to water.

###### Effect of Wind

Due to the stack of cargo loaded on deck, container vessels have high sides and a large windage area, making them more susceptible to the effects of the wind.

The magnitude of wind force depends on the container stacks and the area presented to the wind forward or aft of the vessel’s pivot point.

Consider the effect of wind velocity, especially during berthing/un-berthing, transiting narrow channels (Panama and/or Suez Canal), and when determining the number of tugs required.

Not compensating for wind forces has caused accidents, especially during berthing/un-berthing or when at anchor.

The following precautions should be considered:

Monitor the expected wind force and direction, using all available sources, prior to planning any maneuvering and anchoring operations.

Prior to arrival/departure from the berth, calculate the windage area of the vessel using the Trim and Stability Booklet.

Note: Loadicator software may also provide this value.

Prior to anchoring, take note of the ‘Critical Wind Speed’.

Determine the Wind Force as follows:

- P = wind force = 2 x 10¯⁵ x Am x (VK)² tonnes

- Am = area at side of ship on which the wind acts in m²

- VK = the velocity in kts of the wind on side of the ship

The wind force (P) value will help to assess the tug capacity requirement to counter the effect of the wind.

CAUTION: Container vessels have a large windage area, so it is necessary to properly plan their tug requirements if they intend to carry out pilotage in strong winds. In case sufficient tugs are not available, delay movement until the wind has reduced. In no case should movement be attempted without thorough planning and consideration of tug requirements. At slower speeds and while maneuvering in harbor or close to berths, the wind force can take over the vessel, and things can go out of control quickly.

###### Heavy Weather Precautions with Container Cargoes

To prevent the loss of containers in heavy weather, take the following actions:

Apply additional lashings in advance of the onset of heavy weather.

Increase the frequency of lashing inspections.

Note: Consider personnel safety during lashing inspections. Alter course/speed for this operation and observe heavy weather precautions.

Crew should rig lifelines as applicable on deck prior to entry into heavy weather.

Lifejackets and safety harnesses must be worn when going on deck. Crew should move in groups with established communication between themselves and the bridge. Determine and adhere to reporting intervals.

On returning to the accommodation area, perform a headcount to ensure all have returned.

Stability considerations:

A very stiff vessel will result in violent rolling and excessive strain on the lashings. GM should be lowered to a comfortable value. Likewise, a very tender vessel should also be avoided. Ballast or deballast tanks as required to achieve the desirable GM.

Avoid heavy rolling. Excessive rolling will render the vessel vulnerable to collapsing of tiers due to excess weight coming on the corner posts, particularly if the lashings are slack.

Masters should be aware of the phenomena of synchronous rolling and parametric rolling.

Avoid excessive wave impacts. Reduce speed as a preventive measure. Maintain the speed required to maintain heading and desired track and to best place the vessel out of the bad weather area as soon as possible.

To avoid excessive acceleration forces, consider:

Alteration of course or reduction in speed, or both.

Heaving to early avoidance of areas of adverse weather.

Timely ballasting or deballasting to improve the ship’s behavior, taking into account the actual stability conditions.

Regularly monitor hold bilge soundings and alarms.

At night, switch on deck lights at regular intervals to assess wind and sea impact on the ship, as this may not be readily apparent during darkness.

In case of loss of containers overboard:

Inform the company immediately.

Take photographs of the loss of containers and the sea state.

Make an entry in the deck and official logbook. Especially for containers containing marine pollutants, inform the coastal state.

Broadcast a ‘SECURITE’ message to warn other vessels in the vicinity.

Collect relevant weather fax printouts, weather bulletins, and documented preventive measures taken by the vessel as evidence.

On advice from the company, endorse a ‘Sea Protest’ with the Notary Public at the next port of call with advice from the local P&I club correspondent.

##### Operation Tools

###### Loading Computers

Test loading computers against class-approved test data every three months to ensure operational accuracy. Record the date of this test in the deck logbook and the PMS.

From the approved test conditions, at least one load case (other than light ship) shall be calculated.

Note: Actual loading condition results are not suitable for checking the correct working of the computer.

Normally, the test conditions are permanently stored in the computer.

Steps to be performed:

- Retrieve the test load case and start a calculation run (printout). Compare the stability results with those in the “Final Test Condition for Loading Computer” (approved and stamped by class).

- Change several items of deadweight (tank weights and cargo weight) sufficiently to change the draft or displacement by at least 10%. Review the results to ensure they differ logically from those of the approved test condition (printout).

- Revise the above modified load condition to restore the initial test condition and compare the results. Confirm that the relevant input and output data of the approved test condition have been replicated (printout).

- Alternatively, select one or more test conditions and perform the test calculation by entering all deadweight data for each selected test condition into the program as if it were a proposed loading. Verify the results as identical to the results in the approved copy of the test conditions.

Inform the company immediately if any inaccuracies are discovered.

Conduct a draft survey whenever the vessel is empty to compare the light ship calculation and constant with the shipyard newbuilding.

###### Hydrometers

####### Cargo Measurement Equipment:

Determine the water density at the time of taking the drafts using a glass hydrometer designed for draft surveys.

Hydrometers should be marked:

Medium surface tension

Apparent density in kg/l scale range between 0.990 to 1.040 (1.000 kg/l = 1.000 t/m³)

Instrumental standard 15°C

The instrument should be provided with a certificate of calibration with a maximum error not exceeding ‘x’ kg/l tested against a national standard.

Note 1: Keep a copy of the certificates on board and available for inspection.

Note 2: Apply the hydrometer index error, if any, as quoted on the certificate. Do not apply any correction for temperature.

### 8.2.2 Pre-loading Operations - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Ballast Water

The Ballast Water Management (BWM) Convention came into force on 8th September 2017.

You are required to manage ballast water on every voyage by treating it using an approved water treatment system.

To avoid complications, always ask your agent to approach local authorities at the destination port and advise you of local requirements regarding ballast water exchange or treatment.

Maintain the following for each voyage, regardless of any local forms required for ballast water exchange or treatment:

A ballast water record book.

A ballast water management file containing:

Ballast water handling log.

Ballast exchange plan (include all data) – if applicable

IMO ballast water reporting form.

Ballast Order Book: Orders to ballast or de-ballast a tank must be given in writing by the chief officer to the duty engineer. The duty engineer must inform the chief officer when the operation is completed.

Note: When a ballast control room is located outside the machinery space, the chief officer must still inform the duty engineer in writing of his intentions to ballast or de-ballast tanks. Upon completion of the operation, the chief officer must inform the duty engineer and ensure the overboard discharge valve is shut.

Vessels trading within one COPT zone in the USA are exempt from Ballast Water Management. However, they should confirm specific requirements with the COTP (via agent), if any.

Note: Refer to Chapter 8.4.6 – Ballast Water Management for further guidance

###### Minimum Ballast Requirement during Voyage

Conclude each voyage with minimum ballast, considering weather conditions.

Ballast on board must be sufficient for complete propeller immersion.

During the voyage, as far as possible, keep ballast tanks either full or empty. Slack tanks or holds lead to sloshing stresses and reduce the vessel’s GM.

###### Ballast Operation

When planning ballasting operations, consider the following factors:

Trim and stability parameters of the vessel.

Weather conditions expected during the voyage.

Any special requirements from the charterers, such as Trim Optimization.

Any draft/air draft limitations applicable for the port.

Complete form TANK 15 - BALLAST EXCHANGE PLAN.

When conducting ballast operations, follow these points:

Before ballasting, confirm air vents are in the open position.

Avoid taking ballast in double bottom tanks in rivers or tidal harbors to prevent filter clogging from sediments/mud. If necessary, try to ballast during high water.

Pumps can over-pressurize the tanks, leading to structural damage and damage to cargo.

Take soundings and record in form TANK 16 - BALLAST WATER HANDLING LOG as per the Ballast Water Management Plan (BWMP).

Plan all ballasting/de-ballasting operations to always avoid excessive list and trim. Avoid ballast water overflow while in port. Upon completion of ballast operations, the duty officer shall ensure that all pumps are shut down and all valves properly closed.

Note: Incidents of ballast tanks being holed during the carriage of cargo have been reported. When tanks are ballasted, they can cause flooding of the hold and damage the cargo. Monitor the ballasting operation closely and sound bilges periodically to check for any water accumulation, which gives an early warning of any leakages in the ballast tank.

Complete form TANK 17 - BALLAST WATER REPORTING FORM for reporting ballast water management on board to the shore authorities.

####### Auto-heeling Tanks

Where fitted, operate the system as per vessel-specific work instructions ‘Auto-heeling Tank Operations’.

Maintain the auto-heeling system in good working order, keeping adequate ballast water in the heeling tanks.

During cargo watch, the OOW must ensure regular checks to verify the level of water in heeling tanks.

Upon completion of cargo operations, the Chief Officer must ensure that the auto-heeling system and system valves are shut.

####### Safety and Environment Protection Regulations

Follow safety and environment protection regulations in force during cargo operations, such as:

MARPOL

SOLAS 74 (as amended)

IMDG Code

Strictly observe local regulations.

##### Container Cargo Classification

###### Container Cargo

The modern freight container, also known as the ISO Container, is a standardized unit that conforms to ISO Standards.

Typical ISO (International Standards Organization) shipping containers are manufactured with identical size and specifications in terms of exterior height, exterior width, and exterior length. Standardization of containers and the adoption of the ISO specification enable proper planning, stowage, and securing of container cargoes.

ISO 6346 is the international standard covering the coding, identification, and marking of intermodal (shipping) containers.

Depending on the type of products to be shipped or special services needed, containers may vary in dimension, structure, materials, and construction. Containers onboard ships are generally 20 feet or 40 feet in length. The heights vary from 8 feet to 8 feet 6 inches. High cube containers have a height of 9 feet 6 inches. Half-height containers may be carried on certain specific trades. It is important for ship’s staff to be aware of the structural components of a container unit, especially when identifying and reporting cargo units for damage.

###### Classification of Container Units

Most common types of shipping containers in use:

###### CSC Safety Approval / CSC Plate

The CSC (Convention for Safe Containers) regulation sets important standards for the construction, inspection, and routine testing of containers used for international transport.

According to CSC regulations, every shipping container must have a valid safety approval plate at the time of manufacture. This plate, typically bolted to the outside of the container on the left door, prominently states ‘CSC SAFETY APPROVAL’ along with the country of approval and the approval reference.

###### Container Markings

Container markings include a series of labels and codes on the side and end walls, which provide crucial information such as:

Container code and number

Maximum Operating Gross Weight: The maximum allowable combined weight of the container and its cargo.

Tare Weight: The weight of the empty container without any cargo.

Maximum Permissible Payload: The difference between the gross weight and the tare weight.

###### Cargo Unit Stowage Numbering System

The location of each cargo unit on board is indicated in the Bay Plan (cargo stowage plan) by a 6-digit BAY-ROW-TIER numerical system. This system helps determine the correct stowage position of containers according to the prepared cargo plan.

Bay: The vessel is divided into slots or compartments called bays, numbered from bow to stern. A 20-foot container occupies odd-numbered bays, while 40-foot containers are in even-numbered bays.

Row: This indicates where the container is placed across the width of the ship. Rows start with 00 or 01 in the centre and progress outwards with odd numbers (e.g., 01, 03, 05) on the starboard side and even numbers (02, 04, 06) on the port side. The center row is numbered 00 on vessels with an odd number of rows and 01 for vessels with an even number of rows.

Tier: This denotes the level at which the container is stacked. For on-deck stowage, numbering generally starts from 72 or 82 for the lowest tier and progresses upwards in even numbers. For underdeck stowage, numbering starts from 02 to the lowest tier.

Note: Ship staff must be familiar with the vessel’s layout of cargo areas for effective monitoring of cargo operations.

Caution: Ensure the CSC safety approval plate is in place and container markings are clear and legible to avoid compliance issues. Familiarity with the stowage numbering system is essential for efficient and safe cargo handling.

##### Preparing the Cargo Loading/Discharge Plan

Pre-Arrival Information Required at Loading/Discharge Port:

Upon starting a new rotation under liner service, the vessel must be provided with terminal information to plan loading/discharging. For ports not previously visited, request the following in advance and keep the office informed:

Berth number or name planned for the vessel

Depth alongside

Maximum arrival draft

Under Keel Clearance (UKC)

Water density at berth

Quality of fenders and mooring safety at the pier

Whether discharging will be by shore or ship’s gear

Availability and bollard pull of tugs

Loading/discharge rate

Papers for smooth arrival formalities

Reports/forms required by local authorities prior to arrival

Security level at the port facility

Port Facility Security Officer (PFSO) contact details

Port emergency contacts

Any other relevant information needed before arrival

Cargo Planning / Pre-Stowage Plan:

Cargo operations must be planned adequately with the Master and Chief Officer ensuring safety and all relevant considerations are addressed. Communication with the company, operator, and terminal before arrival is crucial to prevent delays. The terminal planner presents a pre-stowage plan for the vessel’s approval and comments.

The vessel must ensure the pre-stowage plan considers:

Verified Gross Mass (VGM)

Stack weight and height

Container size

Special container requirements

Dangerous Goods segregation

Vessel Metacentric Height (GM)

Stability, stresses, and load distribution

Draft/Air draft limitations

Visibility criteria

Lashing forces

Special requirements from charterers, such as trim optimization

Port rotation

Expected weather conditions

Consider during calculations:

Bunkers

Fresh water

Ballasting

De-ballasting

The completed and verified pre-stowage plan must be presented to the Master for approval.

Despite cargo plans being prepared ashore, the Master and designated officers hold ultimate responsibility for correct stowage, loading, care, and discharging of cargo. Compliance with company instructions on stowage, securing, and care of cargo is mandatory.

Upon plan approval:

Hold a toolbox meeting with Deck Officers and deck watch ratings to discuss the plan.

Ensure Deck Officers have read and understood it.

Discuss IMDG manifests, reefer manifests (temperature instructions), oversized, un-containerized cargo, and any other special cargo details.

Modifications to the Pre-Stow plan must be:

Carefully documented before cargo operations

Approved by the Master

Discussed with Deck Officers and recorded on the plan

Pre-Arrival Loading/Discharging Preparations:

Complete most loading preparations before arriving at the terminal. Ensure the suitability and integrity of cargo equipment prior to arrival using checks as per form DRY 01 - Pre-Arrival Load Disport. Inspect deck and cargo holds. Keep ready:

DG and reefer cargo manifests

Reefer temperature logs

Test the following:

Hydraulic pumps

Portable radios and other communication equipment

Gas detection equipment

Cargo cranes including limit switches and controls

Cargo handling gear like container spreaders

Accommodation ladder, pilot ladders

Safety equipment

Deck lighting

Mooring equipment

Prepare firefighting and SOPEP material before arrival at berth. Check:

Stowage

Lashing gear

Last inventory

Reefer plugs

CO2 firefighting system

Condition of lashing gear

Plug all deck scuppers as soon as the vessel berths.

Segregate and stow hazardous cargo containers per the IMDG Code.

Inspect cargo containers for external damage or leakage. Report any deficiencies before starting cargo operations to the Master and Office and take corrective action as per the company’s defect reporting and rectification procedures.

Provide instructions for the OOW and ratings supervising and assisting during cargo operations.

Upon arrival, complete the Ship/Shore safety checklist with terminal authorities, and both parties should sign the checklist.

Cautions:

Ensure all anti-lifting devices are removed prior to opening hatch covers and re-engaged before loading containers on hatch cover tops

Always use proper personal protective equipment (PPE).

Avoid ballast water overflow in port.

Monitor ballasting operations closely to detect any tank leaks that could lead to cargo hold flooding.

Verify the stability and condition of cargo equipment to prevent accidents.

### 8.2.3 Loading and Discharging Operations - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Loading and Discharging Operations

###### Operational Readiness

Confirm the vessel is ready using vessel-specific checklists and work instructions for the following:

Pre-cargo Operation checklist, form DRY 01 - Pre arrival load disport.

Operation of hatch covers, if applicable and weather permitting.

Inspecting vessel cranes, if used for loading/discharging operations, form DRY 31 - Cargo Hold Preparation.

Inspecting and testing cargo hold bilge non-return valves at required intervals.

Maintenance: Keep cargo gear and equipment well maintained and operational. Repair and record any delays caused by inoperative equipment promptly.

###### Pre-Cargo Operations Meeting

Chief Officer must conduct a pre-arrival cargo meeting with OOW, Bosun, and ratings to discuss:

Cargo Stowage and Operations Plan.

Cargo monitoring and intervals.

Cargo hold entry procedures as per Company procedures and local regulations.

Possibilities of stevedore damages.

Manning requirements.

Other planned operations at port, e.g., bunkering, stores, inspections.

PPE requirements during cargo operations.

###### Verification of Cargo Plan

Upon receipt of the cargo plan from the Planner/Charterer, the Chief Officer must:

Check the total number of containers to load and discharge, clearly identifying 20’, 40’, 45’, reefers, dangerous cargo, and ‘Out of Gauge’ (OOG) cargo.

Input preliminary loading data in the loading computer and check for "Verified Gross Mass" data, permissible stack weights, and calculate the optimum ballast arrangement.

Ensure the vessel’s stability is maintained within limits and discuss conditions with the Master.

Check that lashing forces are within prescribed limits per the loading computer (if available).

Review the BAPLIE file/cargo list received from planners/agents and verify the load and discharge plan.

Coordination with Terminal Planner:

Compare load, discharge, and re-stow lists.

Verify stowage positions, handling, and lashing methods, especially for IMDG cargo and reefer containers.

Confirm the working sequence of the gantries.

Briefings and Documentation:

Brief the planner and lashing gang foreman on vessel-specific lashing arrangements and display a copy in the Tally room.

Provide a copy of the stowage plan to the OOW and ratings on duty.

Inform the Electrical Officer/designated officer regarding the loading reefer container list.

Plan for ballast operations and discuss with the OOW.

Recheck the final plan from planners and update any changes. Notify the planner of discrepancies immediately.

CAUTION: The Master has the right to inspect containers if there is doubt about weight distribution or cargo securing (e.g., listing when lifted, cargo leakage). Inform stevedores/terminal planner prior to opening, reseal the container after verification, and make a log entry.

###### Documents Required Prior to Loading/Discharging

Obtain the following documents from Planners/Agents before loading/discharging:

Dangerous cargo manifest (hard copy and EDI) before loading IMDG units.

Dangerous goods transport document and, where applicable, packing certificates for dangerous cargo units.

Reefer cargo manifest, indicating temperature, vent settings, and other requirements.

OOG cargo/special cargo list and manifest.

Note: The Master must sign the manifest indicating acceptance.

###### Ship-Shore Information Exchange at Berth

Follow vessel-specific checklist DRY 01 - Pre arrival load disport.

The Chief Officer must:

Meet with the terminal representative to discuss and agree on the loading plan.

Ensure ballast pumping rates and loading rates avoid overstressing the hull.

Confirm communication arrangements between the ship and terminal for prompt compliance in case loading needs to be suspended.

Review international and local safety regulations.

Confirm cargo particulars, including the quantity of containers to be discharged and loaded, DG cargoes, and reefer containers.

Discuss UKC restrictions, pollution prevention, domestic garbage disposal, emergency procedures, mooring, and gangway setup.

Address local conditions, arrangements for loading suspension, and the use of shore/ship working gear.

###### Commencement of Cargo Operation

Duty Officer must be on-site at the commencement of cargo operations. If using the vessel's crane, Chief Engineer/2nd Engineer/Electrical Officer must attend until operations run smoothly.

Key Steps:

Record draughts.

Check starting as per Loading/Discharge plan/bays.

Ensure the hatch cover is properly secured.

Start ballast according to the loading/discharge sequence plan.

OOW must be fully conversant with:

Limiting draft of the ship.

Connecting/disconnecting reefer containers.

DG cargo/containers stowage and segregation.

Air draft limitations relative to shore gantry cranes, especially at tidal ports on the rising tide.

Cautions:

The stevedoring supervisor must be instructed in writing about air draft limitations before cargo operations commence (issue the ‘Crane letter’).

Display appropriate safety posters and warning notices.

No crew member or shore personnel should stand, walk, or work under moving loads or operating cranes.

Ensure ship’s cranes are safely turned outboard and out of the way of shore gantry cranes before starting cargo work.

Only trained crewmembers should operate the cranes.

##### Cargo Operations Monitoring

Duty Officer and deck watch must:

Monitor cargo operations to ensure correct stowage, discharge, and securing of cargo as per the approved plans. Immediately inform the Chief Officer if any deviations from the plan are noted.

Supervise the operation of hatch covers.

Always avoid excessive trim and list, especially when bunkering. This will ease spreader operations when working under deck cargo and reduce damage to cell guides and ship structure.

Visually check the drafts upon completion of ballasting and bunkering operations.

Report and handle any stevedores’ damage to the ship/cargo.

Inform the Chief Officer immediately if any malfunction of ballast/heeling pumps/cargo lifting gear is detected. The company must be informed well in advance so that concerned parties can re-plan the cargo accordingly.

Ensure mooring lines remain tight, preventing the vessel from moving alongside or off the berth.

Ensure protective measures such as handrails are placed as necessary according to safety regulations.

Clear all lashing gear before cargo is loaded. Cargo and lashing gear will be damaged if a load is inadvertently landed onto loose lashing gear.

Check that the cargo has been properly lashed/unlashed.

Note: Special attention must be paid to ensure that lashing gear is not discharged with the cargo.

Inspect the quay prior to departure for any ship's lashing gear.

Before reloading the vessel’s lashing boxes, check that they contain the correct number of lashing bins. All lashing boxes and bins should be clearly marked with the vessel’s current and original name.

Follow Checklist DRY 05 - During cargo operations.

Ensure all securing devices of hatch covers, where fitted, are secured in place. The integrity of the entire lashing system for the container stacks depends on proper securing of hatch covers.

Ensure stevedores follow the correct lashing arrangement, including proper securing of twist locks and avoiding the use of mixed twist locks or alien lashing material.

Ensure newer lashing material is used on the outer stacks.

Use appropriate lashing material (stackers/cones, pressure adapters, etc.) as per the CSM during under deck loading.

Ensure that container stacks exposed to wind have additional lashings as per the CSM.

Obtain approval from the cargo foreman and the planner before using the ship’s lifting equipment. Secure the ship’s lifting gear upon completion of operations. Some ports do not allow handling of vessel’s lifting equipment while cargo operations are in progress.

Remember that handling of cargo units by the stevedores does not relieve the Master and the ship staff of their responsibilities to ensure the safe loading and stowage of cargo.

Record Draughts twice a day, once in the morning and again in the evening.

In case of deviation from the loading plan:

The officer in charge should immediately inform the Chief Officer/Master.

Any substantial deviation in the agreed stowage plan should be communicated with Charterers/planner, and corrective actions should be taken to:

Restore the ship to the original loading/unloading plan, if possible, or

Replan the rest of the loading/unloading operation, ensuring that the stress and operational limits of the ship are not exceeded at any intermediate stages.

The modified loading/unloading plan should be agreed upon by both the ship staff and the cargo terminal representative before proceeding further. Cargo is not to be cancelled unilaterally by the ship’s Master. The decision on such matters is to be taken after consultation with the cargo planners, line/trade managers, and the Company.

Verify the Cargo Tally with Charterers as follows on departure from every port:

Total Cargo on Arrival (Units), Dry/Reefer/DG

Total Cargo Discharged (Units), Dry/Reefer/DG

Total Cargo Restowed (Units), Dry/Reefer/DG

Total Cargo on Departure (Units), Dry/Reefer/DG

Note: Complete form DRY 36 - Cargo Utilization Report.

###### Cargo Security and Container Seals

Crew must be vigilant against any possibility of cargo pilferage/tampering. Inform the cargo supervisor, planner, and agent immediately in case of any suspicion.

There are several possible causes for missing or damaged container seals, all of which could present a risk for the carrier and crew.

The crew should pay close attention during the loading operation and the port stay to the condition of the seals on container units. Proceed as follows for each missing or damaged seal:

Report to Chief Officer or the Master.

The Master should inform the charterer, company, and commercial operator as soon as possible.

In case missing or damaged seals are found during the voyage, a report must be made as soon as possible, but not later than within 24 hours.

Fit a seal on containers found unsealed.

Fit an additional seal if found damaged.

Notes:

Container seals are usually provided by the charterers, and the vessel should ensure that there is a sufficient supply of container seals available on board. In general, vessels may carry seals for at least 10% of the ship’s TEU capacity.

Make a log entry mentioning the container number and the circumstances, including the name of the person informed.

###### Container Damage Reports

Inform the Chief Officer if any damage is noticed to any cargo unit.  Issue to the terminal form DRY 39 - CONTAINER DAMAGE REPORT.

###### Handling of Leaking Cargo Units

Regularly check cargo holds and decks during the voyage to ascertain any possible leakages from a cargo unit.

The Chief Officer shall:

- Check the contents of the cargo before proceeding with any clean-up operations.

- Maintain records of materials used and man-hours spent for such cleaning.

The Master must inform the Charterers, Planners, and Office about any leakage of cargo on board. In case of a leaking dangerous cargo container, contact the emergency number stated on the transport document and the operators.

Follow preventive measures as per the Emergency Schedule (EMS).

Cautions: Ensure staff wears proper PPE (Chemical protective suits, rubber gloves, and SCBA) when handling such leaks.

###### Defective Shore/Vessel Machineries

Closely monitor all vessel and shore machinery for any defects or abnormalities that may affect the cargo or cargo hold – for example, leaking hydraulic oil from gantries and spreaders.

Inform the Chief Officer and Terminal/Foreman immediately upon noticing any abnormal condition.

###### Damage to Vessel

Regularly inspect all cargo spaces, cargo gear, and lashing equipment during cargo operations.

Record such inspections in the logbook. Send a copy of the form DRY 25 - STEVEDORE DAMAGE REPORT to the Charterers separately, requesting assistance in getting the repairs done by the terminal.

Do not solely rely on agents to send the copy to Charterers.

Address the damage reports to the correct party. Agents can assist in identifying the correct party responsible. Make every effort to have the damage report countersigned by the foreman/terminal for acceptance or at least for receipt. If they decline, give the agent a copy with written instructions to deliver it to the terminal. The agent must sign the copy for receipt.

If damage affects seaworthiness, carry out repairs before departure from the port.

For stevedore damages, put all time lost and all costs of surveys and surveyors on the stevedore’s account. If any damage is noticed after vessel departure, send a damage notice by email.

Note: Whenever possible, the terminal should repair all damages before departure.

##### Completion of Cargo Operation and Lashing

Ensure correct lashing equipment is fitted as per the approved securing arrangement:

The position of handles and twist locks are properly locked.

Turnbuckles are tightened.

Locking pins/check-nuts are locked tight.

All lashings must be attached to the vessel at the designed locations.

Compare observed drafts with the calculated drafts. If any differences exist, verify that the difference is due to misdeclaration of cargo weights and compensate for such differences to obtain the actual stability parameters.

On every departure, an entry must be made in the deck logbook that "All cargo lashings checked and tightened prior to departure from port". Chief Officers and OOW should not sign statements presented by stevedores to the effect that “All cargo/containers lashed to master’s satisfaction” unless they have physically checked all lashings.

If the crew is required to conduct lashing/unlashing, complete form DRY 30 - LASHING - UNLASHING ASSISTANCE. For reefer containers, records should be kept as per form DRY 28 - REEFER CONTAINER PLUG IN/PLUG OUT REPORT.

###### Preparing for Sea

Ensure all stevedore damage reports are presented and signed prior to departure and repairs, if any, are completed. Inspect and secure all holds and vessel gear such as cranes and grabs for sea. Use a vessel-specific checklist for all necessary checks prior to proceeding to sea.

Ensure all loose lashing equipment and gearboxes are returned to the vessel. Record the location of gearboxes in the Port Log. In some ports, the location of gearboxes is required to be sent to the agents/terminal in advance. Record the ship’s drafts.

###### Departure Condition Reports

The Chief Officer must store a soft copy and take a printout of the final departure stability condition from the Loading Computer. Ensure stability and stress criteria are within limits and meet the damage stability requirements. The Master must verify and sign these.

Masters are required to forward the departure stability condition to the company upon the vessel's departure from the port.

##### Cargo Documents

A container vessel should send the following documents to the office by email at departure from every port:

Reefer log for containers discharged at that port

DG Cargo list

Stability printout – indicating GM, Ballast on board, and Cargo on board

Bunker delivery note/Bunker Survey Report (if any)

Stevedore damage reports (if any)

Details of any expenses incurred by Master – medical visits, etc.

Loading plans, including the plan overview

The Port documents should be sent to the office by email.

Cargo documents shall be kept as stated in Ch. 8.4.1 - General Container Practices / Cargo Documentation.

The terminal representative or agent must sign the letters of protest to indicate receipt and the other documents to indicate agreement and acceptance of survey findings and the time log. In the event of any refusal to sign, the agent should endorse the document concerned to the effect that the terminal or surveyor declined to sign.

Note: Refer to Chapter 8.7.2 for detailed guidance regarding Letter of Protest

###### Documentation Requirements when Trading to U.S. Ports

Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC): This is used as the first part of the Unique Bill of Lading Identifier (UBLI) and consists of a code of four alphabetic characters. All vessels must use the SCAC code as instructed by their commercial/pool operator, owner, or time charterer.

Unique Bill of Lading Identifier (UBLI): When entering the United States, all Bills of Lading are required to bear a unique Bill of Lading Identifier Code. The unique identifier code must contain no more than 16 characters and it must contain both letters and numbers. It is recommended that the 16 characters comprise the following:

SCAC Code

Vessel's 4- or 5-digit call sign

Year of loading the cargo

Month of loading the cargo

### 8.2.4 Laden Passage - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Laden Passage

###### Introduction

It is essential that the cargo entrusted to the ship be delivered in the same good condition as it was loaded.

###### Cargo Condition Inspections and Records

Chief Officer shall:

Sound cargo hold bilges daily and discharge bilge water if any.

Check hatch covers for:

Securing devices are in position and tightened.

Drain valves are free and in position.

In case of bad weather, consider reducing:

Heavy pitching and rolling.

Excess water on deck.

Report any abnormal condition of the containers or lashing to the Master.

Check that:

Cargo has not shifted.

Containers, crates, drums, and any other packing are not leaking.

Daily inspections must be recorded in the Deck Logbook.

###### Cargo Care on Passage

The Chief Officer is responsible for the care of the cargo and for ensuring regular inspections during the voyage.

####### Lashing Control

Take reasonable care to control and conduct daily checks of the lashing condition of the containers.

In adverse weather conditions, carefully evaluate the situation before sending people on deck. Use the "Permit to Work on Deck in Heavy Weather" form.

Note: This is especially important prior to any known heavy weather, immediately after any heavy weather, and during long passages.

Tighten any lashings as required under the supervision of the Chief Officer.

Caution: If entry to the cargo hold is required, ventilate the cargo hold and strictly follow procedures for enclosed space entry.

Make an entry in the Deck Logbook every time cargo lashing is checked.

####### Parting of Lashings and Loss of Containers

Parting of lashings and loss of containers overboard can result from one or a combination of the following factors:

Vessel has too large a metacentric height (GM).

Incorrect stowage of containers.

Insufficient lashing of containers.

Movement of cargo inside a container.

Poor consideration of prevailing weather and failure to take proper precautions.

Carrying a full load of containers, consisting of three, four, and five tiers on deck, stowage should be planned so that the vessel’s GM is not too large. A small GM will produce a longer rolling period and a less violent up-righting moment, reducing the chance of containers breaking loose. Containers stowed on the forecastle deck and aft are more susceptible to movement in a heavy sea. When planning stowage, try to limit the number of tiers in this area.

Never substitute or reduce the amount of lashing required for any unit of cargo to make it easier on stevedores or to reduce time in port to accommodate charterers.

One main factor contributing to the loss of containers overboard is the failure to take timely and positive action when experiencing heavy weather. A reduction of speed and/or an alteration of course will reduce rolling and pitching. In extreme cases, consider heaving-to until the weather abates.

###### Reefer Containers (Temperature Control)

Monitoring temperature during the laden passage for any type of cargo loaded on board can establish a pattern of any irregularities in the observed behaviour of the cargo. Check reefer containers at least twice a day for:

Temperature.

Power connection and proper function.

Note: Report any defects to the Chief Engineer and issue form DRY 29 - REEFER ASSISTANCE REPORT - REEFER REPAIR.

###### Cargo Damage on Passage

In case of suspected or actual damage while on sea passage:

Take corrective actions.

Make an entry in the Deck Logbook.

Inform Charterers and Operations Department.

Make a Note of Protest on arrival at the next port.

Complete a damage report.

###### Soundings

Take a full set of soundings at least:

Once every 24 hours.

At any other time required for stability calculations.

Where remote sounding gauges are used, check these against a manual sounding at intervals not exceeding one month or more frequently if there is doubt about the reliability of the remote gauges. Record the results in the logbook.

###### Cargo Hold Ventilation Requirement for Container Ships

Cargo holds of container ships are fitted with two types of ventilation systems:

Natural Ventilation: Air can enter and leave the hold through vents located above deck level, allowing cool, heavier air from the outside to replace the lighter, rising warm air inside the cargo hold.

Mechanical Ventilation: Mechanical ventilation could be of either the supply or the exhaust type. Container carriers certified to carry D.G. cargo underdeck are fitted with mechanical ventilation fans meeting SOLAS special requirements for ships carrying dangerous goods. Such fans operate in the exhaust mode and can provide at least six air changes per hour for removing vapors from the upper or lower parts of the cargo spaces as appropriate.

Cargo holds designated for carrying refrigerated containers may be fitted with additional ventilation fans that operate in the supply mode. Operation of these ventilation fans will provide forced ventilation required for the operation of reefer container refrigeration units.

###### Portable and Fixed Instruments/Detectors

Chief Officer shall:

- Check multi-gas detection units.

Note: If necessary, calibrate these units and record the findings in the port/cargo log.

Inspect UHF portable radios and explosion-proof torches to ensure they are in good operational condition.

Maintain a documented procedure to sample for hazardous atmospheres with portable equipment.

##### Pre-Arrival Checks and Tests during Laden Passage

Chief Officer shall conduct operational tests of critical equipment and systems three days before arrival and make routine inspections before the vessel's arrival at the discharge port. This allows sufficient time to rectify any defects found, given a sufficiently long sea passage.

Tests and inspections shall include but are not limited to the following:

Hydraulics system

Portable instruments

Ballast system

Deck

Gangways

Cargo gear

Note: Complete forms DRY 01 - Pre arrival load disport and DRY 32 - Cargo Gear Preparation.

##### Automated Manifest System

###### Introduction

Every shipping company has an International Carrier Bond (ICB) in place with U.S. Customs.

This bond is valid for all U.S. ports;

Example:

- The ICB number for Reederei NORD Gmbh is “991431000.”

- The ICB number for Reederei NORD B.V. is “18C001FIN.”

There is also a unique 4-letter Standard Alpha Carrier Code (SCAC) to identify each shipping company.

- The SCAC code for Reederei NORD Gmbh is “RNKO.”

- The SCAC code for Reederei NORD Gmbh is “RNBV.”

The SCAC code must be entered into all Bills of Lading for cargoes bound for U.S. ports.

For Canadian Ports, the ICB Code is “TM 5156312,” SCAC Code is “90KT.”

Note: above is only applicable for vessels managed commercially by Reedderei Nord Gmbh, or Reederei Nord B.V. Other Commercial operators have different ICB or SCAC requirements. Contact the Commercial Operator or Office for advice.

###### Filing Automated Manifest System - USA

All cargoes bound for U.S. ports must have their cargo manifests sent electronically in advance using the AMS. The company has appointed WILHELMSEN in the U.S. to act as the company’s agents for filing the AMS requirements once they are received from the vessel.

The ‘Automated Manifest System Information Requirement’ form explains how the information should be sent. Each time cargo is loaded for the U.S., the completed details must be sent to:

Wilhelmsen as soon as possible after departure,

The Charterer in copy,

NORD Hamburg - Operations Department in copy.

The vessel needs to file the AMS only when on a voyage charter or when instructed by the office or charterer.

Each Bill of Lading will have a unique number formatted as follows:

RNRDP3LK92206051

Where:

RNKO – is the company carrier code.

XXXXX – is the vessel’s call sign.

XXXXXX – is the date/month/year.

1 – is the sequence number for the day which goes from 1-9. If more than 9 B/Ls are issued, the sequence starts again with the next day’s date.

The form ‘Automated Manifest System Information Requirement’ must be completed and sent by e-mail to the General AMS service center as soon as possible after receiving the bills of lading for cargo loaded at all non-US ports.

### 8.2.6 Ballast Water Management - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Ballast Water Management Control

###### Introduction

This procedure guides the handling of ballast water to control water pollution from shipboard operations and reduce the environmental impacts associated with ballast water discharges.

It applies to all operations and activities on board vessels generating wastewater discharged to the sea.

- MARPOL 73/78 requires that all vessels carry a ballast water management plan.

- The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has issued guidelines for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water to Minimize the Transfer of Harmful Aquatic Organisms and Pathogens, recognizing the potential for uncontrolled ballast water discharge to cause harm.

- Several states require vessels to comply with quarantine requirements for ballast management.

- The carriage and disposal of ballast water can significantly contribute to the transfer of species of aquatic organisms and water-borne pathogens from their natural habitats. Vessels must comply with mandatory schemes concerning the handling of ballast water, as per the procedures detailed in the Ballast Water Management Plan.

- The Ballast Water Management Plan minimizes the risk of transplanting harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens from ships' ballast water and associated sediments while maintaining ship safety.

- Studies in several countries have shown that many species of bacteria, plants, and animals can survive in ballast water and sediment, even after journeys of several weeks.

- The subsequent discharge of ballast water or sediment into port waters may establish colonies of harmful species and pathogens, seriously upsetting the existing ecological balance.

- Organisms are transferred between geographically separated sea areas due to ballast water discharge from ships.

###### Responsibilities

Master: Comply with national Ballast Water Management requirements.

Chief Officer: Designated officer in charge of implementing the vessel’s Ballast Water Management Plan.

Chief Engineer: Maintain the vessel’s ballast equipment, such as Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS), pumps, valves, pipelines, and drain cocks, in good and usable condition.

###### Definitions

Regulation D-1 Ballast Water Exchange Standard

- Ships performing ballast water exchange in accordance with this regulation must achieve at least 95 percent volumetric exchange of ballast water.

Regulation D-2 Ballast Water Performance Standard

- Ships conducting ballast water management in accordance with this regulation must limit the discharge of viable organisms, including specified indicator microbes harmful to human health.

Note: D-2 regulations are met by using a Ballast Water Treatment Plant unit.

##### Ballast Water Management

Vessels must follow Regulation D-2.

###### Regulation D-2 - use of Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS)

The use of the Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS) is the mandatory option.

It is part of the Ballast Water Management Plan and must be used in strict compliance with the operation manual.

If local regulations do not accept the treatment of ballast water using the BWTS, then a ballast water exchange must take place as described in the approved Ballast Water Management Plan.

Note: The ballast exchange must be conducted using the BWTS.

###### Ballast Water Treatment

The requirement for ballast water treatment arises from the requirements of regulation D-2 of the International Convention for the Control of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM Convention).

Fig 1 - Generic ballast water treatment technology process options

Ballast Water Treatment Technology

There are two generic types of process technology used in ballast water treatment:

- Solid-liquid separation

- Disinfection

Solid-liquid separation involves the removal of suspended solid material, including larger suspended micro-organisms, from the ballast water through sedimentation (allowing solids to settle out by their own weight) or surface filtration (removal by straining).

Disinfection removes or inactivates micro-organisms using one or more of the following methods:

- Chemical inactivation of micro-organisms.

- Physicochemical inactivation by ultraviolet light irradiation, which denatures the DNA of micro-organisms, preventing them from reproducing. Ultrasound or cavitation (termed 'micro-agitation') are also physico-chemical disinfection methods.

- Deoxygenation by displacing dissolved oxygen with inert gas injection or stripping it by means of a vacuum, thereby asphyxiating the micro-organism.

Most commercial systems employ two stages of treatment: a solid-liquid separation stage followed by disinfection, though some disinfection technologies are used in isolation. One ballast water treatment technology employs chemical enhancement (e.g., coagulation/flocculation) upstream of solid-liquid separation; another employs titanium dioxide (TiO2) to intensify ultraviolet irradiation.

- Use ballast water treatment plants as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

- Maintain them as per PMS.

The contents of surviving aquatic organisms in ballast water discharged from vessels requiring treatment as per the Convention shall meet the following requirements:

- Fewer than 10 living aquatic organisms greater than or equal to 50 microns per cubic meter of water.

- Fewer than 10 living aquatic organisms less than 50 microns but larger than or equal to 10 microns per millilitre of water.

- Vibrio cholera is fewer than one colony-forming unit per 100 ml; Escherichia coli is fewer than 250 colony-forming units per 100 ml; Enterococcus is fewer than 100 colony-forming units per 100 ml.

###### Ballast Water Sampling Points

- Samples shall be drawn:

- at the request and under the supervision of a port state or quarantine officer.

- for required periodic analyses in the presence of the laboratory representative

- Crew shall be familiar with use of BWTS sampling points and the sampling procedure

- The time required to analyse the samples shall not be used as a basis to unduly delay the operations or departure of the ship.

###### Hazards and Safety Measures

Manufacturer’s instructions must be always followed when operating the BWTS. There are various types of BWTS:

- Systems that produce disinfectant on board by electrolysis and inject it into the ballast water.

- Systems where the disinfectant is prepared on board and injected into the ballast water.

- Systems that use UV light to disinfect the ballast water.

Note: Some systems may use back-flush filters to retain or dispose of larger bio-organisms.

Authorized personnel should be familiar with the operation, inspection, and maintenance of the BWTS, particularly the hazards associated with operating the equipment and handling and storing any chemicals used. Where applicable, a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) should be provided, describing the proper storage and handling procedures for the chemicals.

Caution: Do not store wet chlorine in closed and unventilated areas, as wet chemicals containing chlorine may self-react and produce heat and emit toxic and corrosive fumes.

The quantity of disinfectant needed is automatically regulated by the BWTS. The system should not exceed the maximum chemical dosage and the maximum allowable discharge concentration of TRO at any time. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling chemicals, referring to the MSDS for guidance.

BWTS using electrolysis units to produce disinfectant may emit hydrogen (H₂).

Caution: H₂ is highly flammable. Ensure that the space where the electrolysis units are installed is well-ventilated and that the H₂ sensor is in good operational order and tested regularly.

##### Contingency Measures in Case of BWTS Failure

As the vessel's primary ballast water management method is treatment upon intake and discharge, a failure of the Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS) leads to non-compliance with the vessel's certification.

From the point of certification, there is no difference regarding when or where the BWTS fails; technical failure of the BWTS automatically means loss of compliance.

Therefore, all technical failures of the BWTS must be reported to the Technical Superintendent (TSI)/Operations, detailing the following:

- Malfunctions of the BWTS.

- Ports with challenging water quality (CWQ)

From an environmental and operational perspective, the timing and location of the BWTS failure are crucial, as short-term substitute procedures must be defined on a case-by-case basis. Close cooperation between the vessel, TSI, Operations, affected port states, flag state, and classification society is required.

The Master must inform the Flag State and the authorities in the port of destination (through the Agent) and get advice on the actions to implement.

The involved parties should consider the following non-exclusive list of possible contingency measures, depending on the actual situation and practical feasibility:

- Retention of ballast water on board: Completely avoid ballast water discharge in port by shifting ballast internally.

- Internal circulation after BWTS repair: If BWTS failure occurred during ballast intake and the tanks contain partly untreated water that needs to be discharged in the next port, repair the BWTS and perform internal circulation of the non-compliant water through the repaired BWTS before executing standard discharge operations.

- Fallback on D1 standard: Execute ballast water exchange according to the BWMC and as described in the BWMP.

- Discharge of non-compliant ballast water: Transfer ballast water to another vessel, barge, or shore-based reception facility.

Record all actions in the Ballast Water Record Book and create a Defect Report in the PMS Software.

###### In case of BWTS failure

In case of BWTS failure, the master shall:

- Inform Office and Flag State (via Office)

- Inform the Port State authorities in the arrival port

- Obtain advice regarding alternative ballast water management practice accepted by the authorities in the arrival port and the Flag State

- If D-1 treatment method is accepted prepare a Risk Assessment, a Ballast Water Exchange Plan as per vessels BWMP, and submit to Office for approval

- Consider ballasting the minimum SOLAS safe quantity required for the sea passage

- Keep a full and accurate log of ballast operations and make records available to port state authorities.

Note: Pre-planning is essential to maintain safety where compliance with ballast exchange or other ballast water treatment or control options is required.

Consider safety information when preparing the voyage plan. Report in advance to the national monitoring authority the amount of ballast water on board upon arrival, where it was taken, and whether a ballast management procedure has been followed (i.e., Exchange or Treatment).

####### BWTS Failure due to CWQ

In Ports with challenging water quality (CWQ) the vessel shall, before considering bypassing the system, carry out trouble shooting and identify mitigating measures that could assist in continuing the operation using the BWTS, such as:

- Ensure that the restrictions are originating from the water quality and not from other sources (i.e. maintenance, malfunctions, familiarization with system operation)

- Conduct the operation at minimum operational requirements (flow rates)

- Manually operate any back-flushing controls, if possible

- Apply suitable back-pressure at high differential filter pressures

- Maximize UV intensity, where applicable

- Load, if possible, minimum safe ballast quantity via the BWTS and complete the ballasting in less challenging waters immediately after departure from port

If bypassing the BWTS system is unavoidable in CWQ, then:

- Inform Office and Flag State (via Office)

- Consider limiting the number of ballast tanks that will be loaded with untreated ballast water

- After departure, in less challenging water quality, complete the ballasting using the BWTS

- Before arrival in the next port decontaminate the affected tanks

- Obtain further advice on other measures to be taken from the Port State Authorities in the next arrival port (as per BWMC Regulation B - 4.2)

###### Decontamination of the ballast tanks

Decontamination of the ballast tanks in the aftermath of BWTS bypassing is required to bring the vessel back to compliance with D2 standard condition.

####### Guidance

BWMC Convention requires Regulation B-4 - Ballast Water Exchange, requires:

- A ship conducting Ballast Water exchange to meet the standard in regulation D-1 shall:

    - .1 whenever possible, conduct such Ballast Water exchange at least 200 nautical miles from the nearest land and in water at least 200 metres in depth, taking into account the Guidelines developed by the Organization;

    - .2 in cases where the ship is unable to conduct Ballast Water exchange in accordance with paragraph 1.1, such Ballast Water exchange shall be conducted taking into account the Guidelines described in paragraph 1.1 and as far from the nearest land as possible, and in all cases at least 50 nautical miles from the nearest land and in water at least 200 metres in depth.

- In sea areas where the distance from the nearest land or the depth does not meet the parameters described in paragraph 1.1 or 1.2, the port State may designate areas, in consultation with adjacent or other States, as appropriate, where a ship may conduct Ballast Water exchange, taking into account the Guidelines described in paragraph 1.1.

####### Decontamination process

Replace the ballast water in each contaminated tank through ballast water exchange, flushing and treatment.

Do the following:

- Fully discharge the ballast water from contaminated tank through the treatment process

- Strip the tank(s) to remove the residual water

- Flush the contaminated tank(s) by following below steps:

- Add treated water to ballast tank (minimum amount of water should cover the entire bottom of the tank

- Mix the water through the motion of the ship

- Release the mixed waters

- Refill with treated ballast water

###### Recordkeeping

In the instances when the BWTS has not operated as expected owing to CWQ the following shall be recorded in the Ballast Water Record Book:

- the reason why normal ballasting operations were stopped;

- any steps taken to optimize the treatment process and resolve BWMS technical malfunctions;

- the operational demands that were not met and/or operational limitations encountered;

- the steps that were taken prior to a bypass being initiated (as relevant);

- the tanks which have received bypassed ballast water (tank ID);

- the date, time and location where the bypass took place; and

- the decontamination steps that were taken to recover from BWMS bypass as per the approved BWMP, including:

- the start and end locations (GPS coordinates) at which any flushing and/or exchange took place

- the start date and time

- end date and time

- the method of exchange and the volume exchanged and/or flushed.

##### Precautions for Ballast Exchange at Sea (BWTS Failure)

In principle, there are only two methods for exchanging ballast water at sea:

- Sequential Method: The ballast tanks are pumped out and then refilled following a pre-defined safe sequence.

- Flow-Through Method: Overflowing ballast tanks following a pre-defined sequence to dilute the water in the tanks.

Exchange water using the method described in vessel’s Ballast Water Management Plan.

###### Sequential Method

- The process requires the removal and replacement of very large weights from the ship in a dynamic situation.

- The Ballast Water Exchange Plan indicates the status of the ballast water in every tank at the start of each step and includes the assumed weight of fuel and domestic drinking water (Aft of the Engine Room Bulkhead), estimated draughts, bending moments, and shear forces. The actions to take and tanks involved in each step are specified.

- The original condition is restored after each pair of steps.

- Make a positive decision before proceeding to the next pair of steps, considering the ship’s position, weather forecast, machinery performance, and degree of crew fatigue. If any factors are unfavorable, suspend or halt the ballast exchange.

- Heeling effects due to asymmetrical emptying or filling have been considered so that all steps represent upright conditions. Manage actual operations to prevent developing lists during pumping.

- The steps meet trim and draught requirements for propeller and rudder immersion, to avoid slamming while changing ballast, and to maintain bridge visibility within tolerable limits.

- Avoid under pressure in a tank due to emptying, and overpressure when filling.

Note: The consequences of bulkhead damage, or even tank collapse, at sea are more significant than in port.

- Check each step for conformity with strength and stress limitations. Ensure that the minimum intact stability requirements of the ship are met at every stage and that the allowable limits for bending and twisting moments are not exceeded.

- The figure given under bending moments is the percentage of the maximum allowable at the end of each step, before commencing the next step. Some vessels are provided with guidance regarding Sea Going Bending Moments (SGBM) – if provided, this factor is to be used. Still Water Bending Moments (SWBM) are generally available on larger vessels for use in port calculations and thus are of limited value when underway.

###### Flow-Through Method

- The flow-through method, whereby tanks are overfilled by pumping in additional water, can be used in weather conditions marginal for the sequential method, as there is little change to the ship's condition.

- Consider other risks and problems when using the flow-through method.

- Research has established that it is necessary to pump in three times the volume of the tank to achieve a 95% change of water. Pumping in only once the volume of the tank produces a 63% exchange; twice the volume produces an 86% exchange, while four times the volume produces a 98% water exchange.

Note: The ship's design parameters consider storm conditions and resulting water on deck. Therefore, even at maximum pumping rates, any accumulation of water on deck will not affect stability.

- After each step, consider the ship’s position, weather forecast, machinery performance, and degree of crew fatigue. If any factors are unfavourable, suspend or halt the ballast exchange.

##### Sediment Removal or Reduction

Ballast tanks sediments shall be managed in accordance with ship’s Ballast Water Management Plan.

- Where practical, clean the ballast tanks to remove sediments as per the plan agreed with the Technical Superintendent or when the Master considers it necessary.

Note: Flushing helps minimize the amount of mud and debris remaining in a tank but is not effective for removing bacteria, plant, and animal organisms.

- Establish a routine for manual cleaning of ballast tanks on a sequential basis to reduce the build-up of sediment.

- Clean tanks when the vessel moves from one trading area to another, if necessary

- Record all actions associated with sediment removal, whether flushing operations or manual removal of sediment build-up, in the Ballast Water Record Book – code G.

To assist in minimizing the risk of transporting and/or discharging unwanted harmful organisms and pathogens:

- Thoroughly rinse anchors and anchor chains when weighing anchor to remove all organisms and sediments at their place of origin.

- Clean chain lockers regularly during sea passages to avoid accumulations of mud and sediment. Keep any mud onboard to be properly disposed of either in mid-ocean or to shore reception facilities.

- Remove fouling organisms from the hull, piping, and tanks regularly and dispose of removed matter in accordance with local, national, and international regulations.

##### Ballast Reporting Form

- The IMO has developed a form for reporting to a national authority that requests information in advance.

- Some countries require using their own form when reporting.

- Pre-format the reporting forms to contain permanent information such as the ship’s name, IMO number, total number of tanks onboard, total ballast capacity, etc.

###### Specific Reporting Requirements

Several countries, ports, and regions have identified procedures / reporting requirements specific to their needs. While these generally follow similar processes, it is essential that the Master and Chief Officer are aware of the requirements for each port and instruct the other officers accordingly.

Special care and reporting procedures may be required in places like California, the Persian Gulf, the Baltic, the Black Sea, China, etc. Known requirements are identified in the ship’s ballast management plan and should be used as briefing notes for specific trading areas.

##### Crew Training & Familiarization

Train all crew involved in the management of ballast water and operation of the BWTS in accordance with the Ballast Water Management Plan requirements.

##### Maintenance of BWTS

Vessels must use the BWTS for any ballasting/deballasting operations unless other local requirements at the next port of destination prevail.

Procedures described in the Ballast Water Management Plan and the BWTS operation booklet must be strictly followed.

BWTS must be strictly maintained and tested according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the company’s Planned Maintenance System (PMS).

Conduct a Risk Assessment (RA) and implement required mitigating measures before any maintenance.

Quality tests of a sample of discharged ballast water must be conducted in accordance with International Maritime Organization (IMO) and Vessel General Permit (VGP) requirements.



### 8.2.7 Equipment and Tests - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Gas Analyzing Equipment

###### Introduction

Detection and measurement of certain gases are crucial for the safe conduct of vessel operations and the safety of personnel. The main requirements include:

- Checking safe oxygen levels in enclosed spaces.

- Monitoring oxygen content of inert gas.

- Measuring hydrocarbon levels for flammability.

- Checking for hydrocarbon gas prior to entering Fuel Oil Tanks.

- Checking for methane gas concentrations on coal-laden bulk carriers.

- Detection and measurement of other toxic gases.

The chief officer shall:

- Ensure correct operation/calibration of the vessel’s gas measuring equipment.

- Train crew in the use of the equipment

- Maintain training records

###### Minimum Stock of Portable Gas Detection Equipment

Regulations (SOLAS regulation XI-1/7 – MSC.1/Circ.1477 and MSC.1/Circ.1485) require all ships engaged in international voyages to carry at least one portable gas detection instrument on board. Each dry cargo vessel must have two ready-to-use portable gas and oxygen analyzers appropriate to the cargoes being carried.

All Reederei Nord vessels must carry at a minimum the following portable gas detection equipment:

One instrument with pump and extension hose (approx. 15 meters) capable of measuring and displaying concentrations of:

- Oxygen

- Flammable gases or vapours (% of LFL)

- Carbon monoxide

- Hydrogen sulphide

Note: For testing the atmosphere in enclosed spaces before entering and for cargo monitoring.

One diffusion-type instrument capable of measuring and displaying concentrations of:

- Oxygen

- Flammable gases or vapours (% of LFL)

- Carbon monoxide

- Hydrogen sulphide

Note: To be carried during enclosed space entry for inspection.

One portable pump for use with chemical testing tubes (e.g., Draeger tubes) and a sufficient number of chemical testing tubes suitable for the products being carried.

One alco meter

Note: Dry cargo vessels must carry chemical testing tubes listed in form as certain cargoes listed in the IMDG Code require.

###### Contingencies in Case of Atmospheric Monitoring Equipment Failure

In case of a breakdown of monitoring equipment, the company shall arrange delivery of replacement units as soon as possible. This can be done by forwarding available units ready in the office or supplying new units through the agent from the first available supplier.

###### Toxic Gas Detection Analyzers.

For expected poisonous gases due to fumigation or from cargoes not covered by the Multi Gas Detectors, additional tests must be performed with separate pump equipment and respective testing pipes. The required test tubes will be provided based on the cargo hazards as per the IMDG Code.

The chief officer should keep an adequate supply of chemical indicator tubes (e.g., Draeger tubes), specific to the cargoes being carried, and they should be within their expiry date. An up-to-date inventory of all gas analyzers and chemical indicator tubes must be maintained.

###### Calibration and Testing of Portable Gas Detection Equipment

Definitions

Bump Test (Function Check): A qualitative function check where a test or span gas is passed over the sensor(s) at a concentration and exposure time sufficient to activate all alarm indicators to at least their lower alarm setting. The purpose of this check is to confirm that gas can reach the sensor(s) and that all the alarms present are functional. This typically depends on the response time of the sensor(s) or a minimum level of response achieved, such as 80% of the gas concentration applied.

Note: This check is not intended to measure calibration accuracy.

Calibration Check: A quantitative test utilizing a known traceable concentration of test or span gas to demonstrate that the sensor(s) and alarms respond to the gas within the manufacturer’s acceptable limits. This is typically plus/minus 5-10% of the test gas concentration applied unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer or a regulatory agency.

Full Calibration: The adjustment of the sensor(s) response to match the desired value compared to a known traceable concentration of test gas, as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

####### Frequency

Conduct a calibration check of portable gas monitors when the instrument is prepared for enclosed space entry and cargo monitoring or daily.

Carry out a bump test before putting back into service whenever the instrument has been exposed to:

High concentrations of gas

Extreme conditions such as rough handling or possible physical shock

Overexposure to concentrations of target gases

Any portable gas monitor that fails a bump test (function check) or calibration check must undergo a full calibration procedure before further use or be removed from service.

Conduct a full calibration at least once every year as per the instructions specified by the instrument’s manufacturer, or earlier if specified by the manufacturer.

Note: Service providers must include calibration certificates valid for 12 months. The calibration must not be performed on board.

####### Supply of Gas Detectors

Gas detectors will be supplied on an exchange basis. The procedure is as follows:

- Three months before the expiry date, send a request for the delivery of gas detectors via the purchasing software.

- Upon receiving the newly calibrated sets and verifying proper operation, return the old set to the office. The equipment must be returned to the office with all accessories after the delivery of the new equipment.

####### Record keeping

Maintain a TANK 59 - Gas Detectors Inspection for all portable gas detectors.

####### Disposal of Empty Calibration Gas Canisters

Empty canisters should be safely and appropriately disposed of, in compliance with relevant regulations. If required, they can be landed ashore for safe disposal. However, this can incur significant costs in some locations. Alternatively, vessels with a dedicated canister puncture tool can puncture the emptied canisters in a safe, open area and then dispose of them as ordinary waste or scrap.



### 8.2.1 Commercial Guidance to Master - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Guidance To Master

###### Introduction

The most important part of any document is proper signing.

Charter party clauses generally require that documentation be signed by a responsible officer of the vessel and a terminal or charterers’ representative.

Failure to obtain these signatures may invalidate a claim.

If signatures are unavailable from a terminal or charterer representative (either because no personnel are available to sign or because they refuse to sign), issue a letter of protest stating “non-availability of terminal rep” or “refused to sign documents”.

###### Delivery and Redelivery of Vessel

- Master must prepare a Certificate of Delivery/Redelivery of the vessel on her entry/exit to/from Charterer’s service using the company form.

- Master or Chief Officer must accompany the surveyor carrying out the on-hire and off-hire survey.

- Chief Engineer or 2nd Engineer must accompany the surveyor for bunker quantity surveys.

For time charter employment, the vessel is delivered with fuel on board to Charterers. On redelivery, the vessel is delivered with remaining bunkers to Owners, the same as on delivery unless different instructions are received from the Operations department.

Note: Master must ensure that sufficient bunkers are on board, including safety margins.

Keep a record of all details noted by the surveyor. Report to the Operations department if any problems are encountered during the survey.

###### Free Pratique

Free pratique may come from the Port/Terminal/agent.

If unsure whether the vessel has been granted free pratique, contact agents for the time of free pratique and make an entry in the logbook. Issue a Letter of Protest if free pratique is not received within the specified period, as stated in the C/P.

###### Notice of Readiness

It is vitally important that ETA notice requirements are fully complied with.

Inaccurate or untimely reporting may cause delays at load or discharge ports for which the Owners would be held responsible.

All notices sent under Voyage Charter Parties or Sub-Time charters (to Agents, Charterers, Shippers, Receivers, etc.) should be copied to the office using form DRY 10 - Notice of Readiness.

Always tender the Notice of Readiness (NOR) as per the governing charter party terms and to the parties identified in the charterers’ voyage orders.

Note: There is a clear distinction between Notice of Readiness and Delivery Notice given to Charterers.

- Tender NOR on arrival at the customary anchorage of the load port, provided the vessel is arriving within the specified charter party laycan.

- If the vessel arrives at the load port prior to the charter party laycan, tender the NOR at the commencement of the laycan unless authorized by the sub-charterer to tender NOR early or if early loading is granted.

- After arriving and tendering NOR at the customary anchorage (or pilot station if no anchorage is available), if the vessel anchors at some point before the berth to await terminal readiness, re-tender the NOR without prejudice to the original NOR at the time of anchoring.

- If the vessel proceeds directly to the berth from the arrival point or after anchoring, re-tender the NOR without prejudice to the original NOR at the time of all fast.

- If the vessel is subject to port state control restriction (e.g., USCG COC inspection), re-tender the NOR without prejudice to the original NOR when the restriction is lifted.

- When ordered to anchor or drift outside the port, tender the NOR at the designated area and re-tender at the customary anchorage or upon all fast at the berth.

If there is any doubt as to when to tender the NOR, contact the operator as soon as possible.

Tendering Notice of Readiness at Multiple Ports:

- Tender NOR at the first load port upon commencement of lay days or upon arrival, whichever is later, considering all other tendering provisions in voyage orders.

- After completing loading at the first load port, proceed with utmost dispatch to the next load port.

- It is imperative to tender NOR upon arrival at each load and discharge port.

###### Statement of Fact

From the time of the vessel’s arrival at the load port until departure, the Statement of Facts (SOF) is one of the most important records to be kept.

The SOF details all relevant timings of the port call and helps determine which periods of time are for the charterer’s account and which are for the owner’s account.

Note: Accurately completed SOF often assists the company in dealing with disputes with other parties.

- The first important timing is the tendering of the NOR, which triggers the commencement of laytime.

- The SOF must be completed in local time.

- The second event typically occurs at the time of anchor down, if the vessel anchors while proceeding towards the berth, or the time of all fast at the terminal. Both timings signal that laytime resumes. The vessel shall re-tender the NOR without prejudice to the initial tendering in each instance.

- If the vessel does not proceed directly to the loading terminal and remains either anchored or drifting, make an entry in the SOF stating that the vessel is awaiting a “Free Berth.”

Caution: Do not use terms such as awaiting pilot, awaiting tide, or awaiting daylight on the SOF as these are typically erroneously placed while the vessel is actually awaiting a Free Berth. These qualifiers may be exclusions under the charter party terms to deny demurrage to the owner. Avoid their use.

Once alongside the terminal, specify whether the vessel's gangway or the shore gangway is used. Enter the details of the pre-cargo loading operation into the SOF, including timings of cargo surveyor’s activities, arranging ship/shore cargo gear, sampling, pre-discharge conference, etc.

Note: If the shore gangway is used, time will count as demurrage. If not specified whether it is a shore/vessel gangway, time cannot be reclaimed as demurrage.

Details of the actual cargo operations follow, including the commencement of discharge, terminal stoppages and resumption of cargo operations, completion of cargo operations, shifting pours, cargo trimming, etc.

For Double Banking operations, ensure the SOF reflects timing details of fenders off and both vessels separating.

Include any cargo discrepancies and amounts in the SOF. As general practices, it is recommended to insert:

- All cargo discharged/loaded in sound condition and according to the B/L and Cargo Manifest.

- No cargo operation stoppages or delays occurred on the ship's account.

Shippers/agents may include weather conditions at the berth while the vessel is waiting for a free berth at anchorage. Clause the entry as follows: “For receipt only. Whilst vessel at anchorage, weather conditions prevailing alongside at berth and effect (if any) on cargo operations are unknown to master/vessel.”

###### Mate’s Receipt

A Mate’s Receipt is issued when goods are placed on board the ship after verification of quantity and condition. It is not a legal requirement but serves as a procedural convenience.

##### Bills of Lading

Bills of Lading (B/L) should be signed by the master prior to departure from the load berth or port.

As a legal document, it is crucial that all information on the B/L is completely accurate.

The B/L is a separate contract from the voyage charter party.

The master must ensure this document accurately reflects the cargo's condition and quantity. Agents should provide shippers/charterers with B/L requirements before loading and submit them to the Operations department for approval.

Checks when signing Bills of Lading:

- B/L number: Report the correct number of original bills of lading signed (e.g., 3/3).

- Name of vessel

- Name of master

- Type/quantity of cargo

- Load/discharge port

- Consignee/Consignor/Notifying party/other parties

- Charter Party date

Quantity of Cargo: The cargo quantity on the B/L must match the signed Mate's Receipt.

- Do not sign a B/L acknowledging the receipt of goods not loaded.

Note: The master is not obliged to sign a B/L if he suspects inaccuracies or if he has no reasonable means of checking the particulars.

Payment of Freight: A B/L without a reference to freight payment is only a receipt for cargo. A B/L marked “Freight Paid” or “Freight Prepaid” can serve as a receipt for both cargo and freight money. Request instructions from the Operations Department and Time Charterers (not Voyage Charterers) if such remarks should be included.

Clean B/L: Charterers may require B/Ls to be marked 'clean on board'. Stop loading immediately if impurities are found that could affect cargo quality. Contact the Operations Department immediately if in doubt. The master should ensure that either:

1. The following clauses are incorporated into the B/L:

- Paramount clause

- Both to blame collision clause

- Hague Rules or Hague Visby Rules

- York-Antwerp Rules

- New Jason clause

2. Or the following wording is included in the B/L:

    - “All terms, clauses, conditions and warranties including the arbitration, choice of law, time bar, and time limitation clauses of the charterparty dated … are hereby incorporated into this bill of lading.”

    - “One original bill of lading must be surrendered duly endorsed in exchange for the goods or delivery order.”

If either the C/P date or the above clauses are not incorporated into the B/L, the Master must tender a Letter of Protest.

Notes:

A letter of protest issued by the vessel against the shipper(s)/terminal(s) regarding B/L has no legal effect/value against third parties (i.e., Receivers). The vessel must deliver the cargo quantity and quality as described in the ‘clean on board’ B/L. Such cases could result in large claims.

The B/L is a legal document proving that the cargo has been placed onboard the vessel in the owner's custody. It also serves as a financial and negotiation tool. A B/L with master's remarks would be rendered without value and un-negotiable. Financial institutions/banks may not accept a claused B/L as a financial guarantee.

Claims related to “clean on board” B/Ls and letters of protest or indemnity are not covered by P&I, being illegal, and result in direct expense for the owners.

Caution: Do not sign an inaccurate B/L or authorize anyone else to do so.

The vessel shall not carry an original B/L from the load port to the discharge port unless all the original B/Ls issued have been marked with the following wording: “One original Bill of Lading retained on board against which Bill of Lading delivery of cargo may properly be made on instructions received from shippers/charterers.” Where such a B/L is presented, it is important that the master follows the procedures advised by the operations department.

If contradictory instructions are received from the commercial operator, the master shall refer the matter to the operations department for further advice.

In case the Charterer wishes to change the original issued B/Ls after they were signed:

- The re-issuance of the B/Ls must be approved by the Owners.

Note: Only one set of B/Ls can be in circulation for any particular loaded cargo.

Caution: Do not make any changes in the B/Ls without confirmation from the operations department.

- The master must obtain written confirmation from the operations department that all the originally signed B/Ls are in the owner’s/manager’s possession and destroyed.

- The master may then sight and approve the new documents before issuing a letter of authorization to the agent to sign a new set of B/Ls on his behalf.

Contact the operations department for instructions before signing the B/Ls if:

- The discharge port stated in the B/Ls conflicts with the voyage orders.

- The orders received from the vessel’s commercial operators (if any) contradict the owner’s instructions.

Warning:

Do not sign a blank B/L.

Do not commence discharge unless you have received a duly endorsed original B/L or instructions from your head owners to release the cargo against a letter of indemnity.

###### Bill of Lading in Container Trade

In container trade, the freight forwarder usually represents the Consignee/Shipper, while the liner agent represents the Carrier (shipping company) within a certain geographical area.

The Carrier or their agent is responsible for issuing B/L to the Shipper or their Agent in exchange for the receipt of cargo.

The issuance of B/L is evidence that the carrier has received the goods from the Shipper or their Agent in apparent good order and condition.

Due to the quick turnaround in the container trade and the number of packages carried, liner agents and freight forwarders handle the cargo-related documentation, including preparing and releasing B/Ls.

###### Electronic Bill of lading (eBL)

BIMCO’s eBL clause should be incorporated into charter parties if the parties intend for charterers to order owners to issue eBLs.

Carriage of cargo under electronic (paperless) systems is now covered by P&I Clubs, provided the system has been approved by the International Group of P&I Clubs (IG). Systems administered by Bolero International Ltd (Bolero) and Electronic Shipping Solutions (essDOCS) are currently approved by the IG.

The eBL is created on the system, uploaded, and sent in draft form for approval between shipper and carrier. The eBL can incorporate a charter party or other external terms.

Once agreed, the carrier issues the eBL, which is then sent by the system to the next party in the chain (e.g., shipper). The eBL can also be passed back and forth between holders if amendments to the document are needed. Like a paper B/L, there can only be one holder of an eBL at any time.

Both systems rely on the principle of attornment to enable the new holder of the eBL to obtain title to the goods. Each time the eBL is transferred, the system generates an automatic notice from the carrier to the new holder of the eBL, confirming that the goods are now held to the new holder’s order. Both systems have procedures for switching the eBL to a paper B/L at any point in the transaction.

###### Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC)

This is a requirement from the US Customs automated manifest system. All Bills of Lading (B/Ls), cargo manifests, cargo declarations, and other cargo documents for shipments entering the USA must bear a unique identifier code. Vessel owners/operators are required to have an official SCAC for all vessels trading in the USA.

- To determine which SCAC to use, refer to the Charter Party (C/P).

- Each unique B/L identifier will consist of alphabetical and numerical characters not exceeding 16 characters in length.

- This applies to each set of bills. If three original bills are required for a parcel, each will have the same number on the original, duplicate, and triplicate original bills.

###### Letter of indemnity

A Letter of Indemnity (LOI) is an enforceable promise made by time charterers to shipowners to hold the shipowner harmless against any liability, loss, or damage incurred as a result of complying with a request made by time charterers.

LOIs are normally requested in the following situations:

- Delivery of cargo without surrender of original B/L

- Change of destination/Deviation

In most cases, an original B/L will not be available at the discharge port, so cargo will be discharged against an LOI. The charterer will normally send the LOI to the office for review on behalf of the owners or forward it to the head owner for approval. Once the LOI is approved, confirmation to discharge the cargo will come from the Operations department. Some charter parties include an LOI invocation clause, making the LOI part of the charter party. In these cases, no formal LOI will be received.

###### Letter of Authority (LoA) to Sign B/L

Bills of Lading must be presented to the Master prior to departure from each loading port for signature. If this is not possible, issue a Letter of Authority (LoA) to have the Bills of Lading signed on the Master’s behalf.

- Always address the LoA to “Time Charterers (Company Name) and/or Their Nominated Agents.”

- Use the Owner’s format, form DRY 21 - Authorization Letter to Sign Bill of Lading.

- Clearly state in the written authorization that the B/Ls should strictly conform to the Mate’s Receipt and have the owner’s final confirmation.

###### Deadfreight

Charterers may require the vessel to issue a dead freight for unused reserved slots in the containership, representing a loss of revenue for the carrier. Therefore, dead freight is charged to the shipper to recoup some of that loss.

While this procedure is not typically used on container vessels, in cases of receiving short cargo, the vessel must only sail after receiving the charterer’s specific instructions.

If requested, use form DRY 23 - Deadfreight Letter.

###### Stevedore Damages

Damage reports to be handled as per c/p requirements, which mean to be reported to Stevedores/Charterers/ Agents immediately after occurrence with copy to Operations Department.

In case of damages which affect seaworthiness/cargo worthiness/safety regulations Office to be immediately notified as per communication Matrix.

Procedure - Dealing with Stevedores Damage Reports

The Chief Officer and OOW shall follow this procedure

Before any operation: The Chief Officer shall, if possible, agree on the vessel’s condition with the stevedoring company foreman. When stevedore damage is observed:

a) The Duty Officer shall:

- Immediately inform the stevedore foreman.

- Inform the Chief Officer or Master.

- Witness the inspection of the damage.

- Sign the damage report as a witness.

b) The Chief Officer or Master shall:

- Inspect the damage with the stevedore foreman and agree on the extent of it.

- Take photographs of the damage.

- Complete the Stevedore Damage Report, form DRY 25 - STEVEDORE DAMAGE REPORT.

- Communicate full details of the damage to the company and liaise with the Technical Superintendent for the provision of a shore workshop to assess and repair the damage.

c) Details to be provided to the company:

- The exact location and dimensions of any structural damage.

- Details of any equipment damaged.

- Any damage to fuel or water tanks.

- Any damage to electrical equipment or cabling.

- Any damage to insulation.

d) Attach supporting documents to the Stevedore Damage Report:

- Ensure the Duty Officer signs the damage report as a witness.

- Obtain the signature of a responsible party (stevedores, agents) if possible.

- Ensure the Stevedore Damage Report is signed by at least two persons.

Note: If the stevedore foreman or other shore representative refuses to sign, record this fact on the form.

e) Send the completed report by email within 24 hours to:

- The company

- The charterer

- The charterer’s agent

- The stevedore foreman

Note: Attach supporting documents and photographs.

f) In cooperation with the Technical Superintendent/MSI, assess whether:

- The damage will be repaired by the stevedore company or their sub-contractors.

- It will be necessary to arrange for a shore workshop to assess and repair the damage.

- The damage can be satisfactorily repaired by the crew.

Damage Requiring Class or Shore Facility Intervention: If the Master has any doubt that the vessel’s seaworthiness has been affected, inform the company immediately. The company will decide if class attendance is required and arrange it.

Damage that can be Repaired by the Vessel:

- Provide the following information to the company:

- Estimated amount of material required to repair the damage.

- Estimated man-hours required to repair the damage.

g) After the damage has been permanently repaired, state and close the Stevedore Damage Repair, include all available repair reports and class statements, and forward them to the Technical Superintendent/MSI.

    - Completed

###### Double Banking on Containers

Double banking is unusual for container vessels unless port limitations require it or containers need to be unloaded to barges using ship’s gear or floating cranes. Double banking can be considered a modified form of ship-to-ship (STS) transfer due to the risks involved, such as vessel damage.

Review the charter party before conducting double banking operations. Double banking may fall under a “Ship to Ship Transfers” clause if it involves a transfer between vessels.

Note: If double banking operations are not covered in a charter party, it may be unclear who is responsible when things go wrong.

- These clauses typically make the charterer responsible for any damage to the vessel caused through hull contact or during cargo operations. The shipowner may also specify that charterers remain liable even if such an operation is ordered by port authorities.

Master’s Role: Double banking clauses will usually provide that the operations are subject to the Master’s approval. But this does not mean the Master has an absolute right refuse to do these operations.

STS Service Providers and Letters of Indemnity

The charter party clause should place responsibility for the STS operation on the charterer, who usually contracts with STS Service providers.

STS Service providers often ask the Master to sign a letter of indemnity, stating that the vessel’s owners take all liabilities arising from the STS operation. Masters should avoid signing these letters.

- If commercial pressure requires signing, ensure:

- Received charterer’s instructions and authority to sign on their behalf.

- Seek advice from the Operations department.

- If there is no time to get instructions from the charterers, sign the letter “for receipt only” and immediately inform the charterers that the LOI has been received in line with their instructions for the double banking and STS operation.

  - Note: if the vessel is ordered to conduct such operation obtain advice from the Operations department.

##### Off-Hires/Deviation

Inform the Operations department immediately in a separate message if any of the following occur, whether at sea, in port, or at a safe anchorage:

- Major deviation

- PSC issues

- Stevedore damages

- Any technical issue that could affect/restrict vessel performance regarding speed/consumption, loading/discharging capacity

- Delays such as engine trouble, equipment breakdown, deviation for sickness or stores, repairs, or damage

- Delays in ETA of more than 12 hours due to weather conditions

If the vessel is deviated for any reason, send a complete deviation report to the Operations department at the first opportunity, including time lost, extra distance covered, fuel consumed, etc.

To report use below template:

Times are in UTC:

Off-hire commenced	:	Date / Time	FO	DO

Off-hire completed 	:	Date / Time	FO	DO

Off-hire used 	:	             Hours.	            FO	DO

Explanation: Reason for off-hire.

In addition to SOF.

Disruption or delay in loading or discharging should be mentioned in the Port Log / SOF and issue a corresponding Letter of Protest (LOP) indicating which party caused delay, “ship” or “shore.”

###### Weather Routing / Performance Evaluation

Charterers generally provide vessels with weather routing advice from a service supplier, depending on the terms of the Charter Party with Owners. The vessel is described as capable of steaming fully laden and/or in ballast at a certain speed and consumption.

There are two general types of operational weather services provided by weather routing companies:

Optimum Ship Routing: Developing the “best route” for a ship based on existing weather forecasts, ship characteristics, and special cargo requirements.

Vessel Performance Monitoring: Monitoring the vessel's performance based on the described speed and consumption in both fully laden and ballast conditions.

Procedures:

- Provide the required information to the weather routing service to perform their services.

- Discuss the Master’s intended route with the appointed routing company to determine the most ideal and cost/fuel-efficient route.

- The final decision on the vessel's safe navigation remains with the Master. If the Master decides not to follow the given recommendations or needs to deviate from the agreed route, including the explanation, inform the operations department, weather routing company, and charterers.

- If the vessel cannot proceed at the ordered speed or any other speed specified in the TCD, notify the operations department.

- Deviation from the recommended route should be done with caution, as there is a fine distinction between a Master’s navigational responsibilities and the obligation to follow employment instructions. It is often found that the Master was in breach of his obligation to act with utmost dispatch.

###### Berth Letters

Loading terminals may tender letters imposing charges on the vessel for delays often beyond crew control. It is strongly recommended to avoid signing such letters. Charterers under the CP may put the vessel off hire for the lost period, but the vessel should not pay terminal fees.

In such situations:

- Notify the operations department immediately.

- Prepare a Letter of Protest (LOP) to the Charterers.

Note: Once a letter is signed, a direct contract is formed between the vessel/her owners and the terminal.

### 8.2.2 Letters of Protest and Notes of Protest - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Letters of Protest

###### Introduction

Cargo contaminations/shortages, operational failures/delays, and contractual disputes may result in substantial claims to owners. Promptly alert owners and arrange legal assistance and P&I attendance to mitigate risks.

It may take months for the owner to be alerted of a claim from a third party, including charterers, receivers, operators, or terminals. The Master should alert all interested parties, including owners, promptly, and lodge a Letter of Protest (LOP) whenever there is a possibility of any claim.

An LOP is always addressed to a named party or person. It serves the purpose of:

- Recording a disagreement with another party concerning some matter over which the recipient has some control and holding the recipient responsible for any legal or financial consequences arising from the subject matter being complained about.

In some port state jurisdictions, an LOP must be sworn before a court of law or a notary public. If this situation arises, the Master is to contact the office and/or local P&I.

Below are examples of when letters of protest should be issued. Feel free to issue additional protests if circumstances require it. The company has provided a set of standard LOP templates to assist the Master. If the Master receives an LOP, alert the office and sign

    - “For receipt only, without prejudice or admission of liability.”

###### Letters of Protest Guidelines

The Master shall protect the owner’s interests by protesting for:

####### Loading Port

Master shall issue an LOP for:

- Late acceptance of NOR

- Unsafe berth

- Delays to vessel

Note: If the vessel is delayed waiting for a berth or at the berth for terminal requirements

- Late issuance of free pratique

Note: If free pratique is not granted within 6 hours after tendering NOR, the Master must issue a notice of protest (NOP) to the port authority and the terminal.

- Stevedores/Shore Labors unsafe operations on board

- Reefer containers condition once loaded if:

- "Hot Load" condition

- Discrepancy in stowage position

- Wrong set temperature

- Wrong vent setting

- Malfunctioning reefer unit

- Large difference between set & loading temperatures

- Inadequate lashing arrangement of the cargo unit (OOG)

- Not providing lashing/securing inspection or survey certificate for all OOG cargo

- Shore stoppages

- Slow loading rate

- Short loading or overloading by shore

Note: If the agreed cargo nomination was not supplied in full or significantly exceeded on a shore stop

- Excessive time waiting for delivery of cargo documentation

Note: When the vessel's departure is delayed for terminal requirements after leaving the berth (usually to await the delivery of cargo documents)

- Non-compliance with charterer’s B/Lading details

- Not incorporating necessary clauses on B/L

- Paramount clause

- Both to Blame Collision Clause

- Hague Rules or Hague Visby Rules

- York Antwerp Rules

- New Jason Clause

Note: Refer to Ch. 18.03 Commercial Guidance to Master – Bills of Lading

- Dead freight (if instructed by charterers)

- Failure to insert SCAC code for cargoes destined for US ports

Note: It is best if the assigned code is included on the actual B/L. Each B/L must be assigned a code and reported to U.S. Customs at least 24 hours prior to arrival at the discharge port.

- Refusal to sign vessel's documents

- Receiving a letter of protest from the terminal

Note: The Master should acknowledge receipt “for receipt only, without prejudice or admission of liability.”

- Inadequate berth rendering arrangements

- Shore workers misusing ship’s equipment and ignoring duty officers’ advice

Inform the company immediately for further advice and guidance.

####### Discharge Port

Master shall issue an LOP for:

- Late acceptance of NOR

- Delays to vessel

- Late issuance of free pratique

- Shore restrictions

- Shore stoppages

###### Note of Protest

A Note of Protest (NOP) is a solemn declaration made on oath by a Ship Master about circumstances beyond his control that have or may have caused loss and/or damage to his ship or cargo or required actions that may render owners liable to legal action by another party. It is generally addressed as “To Whomsoever It May Concern” and must be made before a notary public, magistrate, consular officer, or other authority.

Issue an NOP when:

- The ship encounters conditions of wind and sea that may result in cargo damage.

- The ship is damaged or there is reason to fear damage.

- Stress of weather prevents normal precautions in ventilating perishable cargo.

- Cargo is shipped in a condition likely to deteriorate during the voyage.

Note: The protest is effective only if the bills of lading were endorsed to show the condition of the cargo at shipment.

- Serious breach of C/P terms by the charterer or agent.

- Consignees fail to discharge or take delivery of cargo and pay freight per C/P or B/L terms.

- In all cases of general average.

Protests should be noted as soon as possible, certainly within 24 hours of arrival in port, and for cargo protests, before removing the cargo wholly or in part. There is no provision for the recipient’s signature.

Supporting documents required:

- Deck Logbook pages

- Official Logbook pages

- Weather reports

- Any picture evidence

- Extended Protest

At the time of noting a protest, the Master should reserve the right to extend it. Since it is impossible to ascertain the full extent of loss or damage at the time of noting the protest, an extended protest should be made when relevant facts come to light.



### 8.2.3 Cargo Shortage and Damage Claims - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Cargo Shortage and Damage Claims

###### Introduction

Most cargo loss or damage claims can be prevented through proper vessel maintenance and cargo care. If a vessel causes loss or damage to cargo and carriers are held liable, they must compensate cargo interests for their damages.

###### Cargo Shortages

Cargo shortages on container trades can result from:

- Collapse of stow and loss at sea due to bad weather or improper stowage.

- Shipper’s misdeclared weight.

- Shipper’s improper stowage of cargo inside the container.

###### Cargo Damages

Cargo damage can occur at any stage of the shipment cycle due to long travel times and various modes of transport (land, rail, and sea), as well as environmental factors.

Types and Causes of Cargo Damage:

Wet Damage:

- Common causes during sea transport include heavy weather, leaking hatch covers, and ingress of ballast water into holds.

- Sea water leakage into cargo holds can accumulate at the bottom, flood the holds, and damage cargo inside containers due to:

- Leaking cross-joints

- Poor condition of compression bars, rubber gaskets, hatch coamings, transverse packings, drain channels, non-return valves, cleats

- Bilge water remaining in holds

- Ingress of ballast water into holds

- Broken/damaged sounding and vent pipes

- Cracked shell plates

- Containers with holes

- For containers stowed on deck, water ingress can occur through holes or damaged doors/gaskets.

Damage to Containers and Cargo: Collapse of container stow on board, often due to misdeclared weight and improper cargo stowage inside containers. Heat damage from misdeclared dangerous goods catching fire or fires on board.

Temperature Damage to Reefer Cargo:

Cargo defrosting due to:

- Incorrect settings on reefer containers

- No electricity supply to reefer containers

- Malfunctioning reefer container units

###### Mitigation of Damage

All possible measures should be taken to mitigate damage, provided they do not pose a risk to the vessel's safety, navigation, or further damage to cargo. Proper maintenance and handling are crucial to prevent damage and avoid claims.

Preventive Steps:

- Diligent passage planning to minimize the impact of bad weather.

- Acting on the latest weather forecasts to avoid severe weather.

- Avoiding excessive vessel motions by timely altering course or speed.

- Preventing water shipping on deck/hatches through prudent ship handling and correct weather routing.

- Ensuring each container has a Verified Gross Mass (VGM).

- Checking stack and lashing forces using class-approved lashing programs.

- Ensuring correct lashing application by stevedores.

- Regularly checking and tightening lashings as needed.

- Monitoring the condition of lashing equipment and replacing damaged or worn gear.

- Issuing Container Damage Reports to terminals for container structure damages.

- Complying with IMDG Code regulations for segregation.

- Correctly stowing DG cargoes to avoid fire incidents.

- Monitoring hot work permissions and hot area stowage.

- Regularly inspecting and maintaining hatch cover seals and all entry point seals to vessel holds.

- Regularly cleaning hold bilges and ensuring bilge alarms function correctly.

- Maintaining ballast systems (valves, sounding pipes, overflow pipes) per PMS.

- Setting reefer containers correctly (temperature, ventilation, defrost).

Reporting: Use form DRY 39 - CONTAINER DAMAGE REPORT for documenting damages

### 8.2.4 On-hire & Off-hire Surveys - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### On Hire/Off Hire Surveys & Inspections

###### Introduction

Normally, under the terms of the charter party, the charterers appoint both the on-hire and off-hire surveyors/inspectors. The on-hire survey is typically strict and critical, whereas the off-hire survey may overlook or fail to record certain items.

###### Responsibilities

Master: Liaise with charterers and the operations department for the survey.

Chief Officer: Accompany and undertake the survey with the surveyor/inspector.

Chief Engineer: Accompany the surveyor during the bunker survey.

###### On Hire and Off Hire Survey Options

A) On/Off Hire Condition Survey:

- A visual inspection of vessel holds, main deck, and cargo working areas to identify any pre-existing damage. A survey report with photographic evidence is issued. For container vessels, the inventory of lashing equipment will be verified by the attending surveyor.

B) On/Off Hire ROB Bunker Survey:

- A bunker survey is performed, taking care to sound all tanks and correct for temperature and density, including the consumption of D.O. and F.O. up to vessel delivery at the pilot station.

C) On/Off Hire Condition and ROB Bunker Survey:

- Both A & B surveys are performed jointly.

###### On Hire and Off Hire Survey

These surveys are undertaken either before the vessel is delivered into a charter or redelivered from a charter.

The survey report should include a detailed description of:

- Vessel's cargo spaces/deck areas structural condition, with special attention to container cell guides and cargo hold structure.

- A complete inventory as per the Cargo Securing Manual verified by the attending surveyor.

The surveyor should attach ‘Notice of Damage or Loss Reports’ to his report and quote the notice number, date, and port in his findings. It is essential to keep a careful check on any damage or loss caused to the vessel and ensure that notices of damage or loss are correctly completed and filed.

- Any new or latent damage discovered during the survey should be reported using a ‘Notice of Damage or Loss Report’ and sent to the charterer and the operations department.

- The Master should verify that the survey report is complete and correct.

- If there is early departure or sailing immediately after the survey, instruct the surveyor or agents to forward the report to the vessel's next port of call.

- Upon receiving an on/off hire survey report, the Master should confirm its acceptability to the operations department.

If a charterer decides against appointing a surveyor, notify the operations department. In the meantime, the Master, Chief Officer, and Chief Engineer should conduct the on/off hire survey.

- Produce a report listing all damages and losses, supported by ‘Notice of Damage or Loss Reports.’

- Make a note in the deck logbook that the on-hire/off-hire survey was conducted by the ship's staff.

##### Tanker Operations - General Precautions

###### SSSCL – Ship Shore Safety Checklist

The responsibility for the safe conduct of operations while a tanker is at a terminal is shared between the tanker’s Master and the Terminal Representative.

Before cargo or ballast operations start, the Master (or his/her representative) and the Terminal Representative should communicate and:

- Agree in writing the transfer procedure and sequence of products, including the maximum loading or unloading rates and initial and topping-off rates (see part 6 of the SSSCL).

- Agree in writing the action to be taken in an emergency while the tanker is at the terminal.

- Complete and sign the SSSCL sections appropriate to the operation.

All parties should agree on appropriate actions and record them on the SSSCL. Ensure that all relevant sections of the Ship/Shore Safety Checklist (SSSCL), conforming to the guidance provided in ISGOTT Sixth Edition Chapter 25, are completed by the vessel during every cargo, tank cleaning, or ballast operation at a terminal or during ship-to-ship transfer operations.

The chief officer shall complete the ISGOTT Ship/Shore Safety Checklist (as per form TANK-09) and any terminal equivalent before starting cargo operations.

When completing the SSSCL, the chief officer shall ensure that:

- Each agreement is properly completed if it is applicable to the cargo operation.

- Agreements are understood and complied with during the cargo operation.

- The cargo and ballast transfer plan is updated to reflect the agreements documented in the pre-transfer conference (PTC).

- Repetitive checks are completed in accordance with the PTC.

- A responsible officer conducts the repetitive checks on deck at least once during each watch period.

- All appropriate records related to the requirements of the SSCL are maintained and in order.

Note: The completion of the SSSCL should be documented in the Official Deck Logbook.

###### Fire and Spill Response Equipment

Keep the below equipment ready for protecting the vessel and the environment:

At the cargo manifolds:

- Fixed foam monitors

- Two fire hoses with portable foam applicators

- 40 liters of foam compound

- Two dry powder fire extinguishers

- Oil spill response equipment and materials

At the after end of the tank deck on each side of the accommodation block:

- Oil spill response equipment and materials

- Wilden pump

Note: Fully rigged, earthed, and tested for operation.

###### Gangway Notices

Display the below items at the gangway:

- No-smoking notice

- No visitors notice

- Security notice

- Ship's fire wallet

###### Scuppers & Save-alls

Before starting cargo operations:

Plug all deck scuppers.

Plug the save-alls at the manifolds, hydraulic mooring winches, and fuel tank air vents.

Note: Test the scupper plugs and save-all plugs for a tight fit.

Drain accumulated water periodically, after approval of the OOW & terminal.

Replace scupper plugs immediately afterward.

The crew member draining water should:

Never leave the location.

Continuously monitor the overboard side.

Immediately close scuppers on sighting any oil sheen or traces in the water.

Inform the OOW if oil traces are observed in the water.

###### Fire Wires (Emergency Towing-off Pennant)

OCIMF no longer supports the use of emergency tow-off pennants.

However, some terminals may still require such lines to be provided when tankers are moored alongside. The master must obtain this information on arrival and comply with such requirements, if any.

If needed, secure fire wires as per the terminal requirements (Ref OCIMF MEG 4 - Ch 4.7):

- Rig the fire wires one forward and one aft, with the outboard eye close to the water's edge or to the height above water required by port regulations.

- Turn the inboard end of the fire wires up on the bitts and lash, leaving no slack on deck.

- The deck watchman should tend the fire wires regularly as the draft changes.

- Keep the outboard eye at or about the water's edge.

###### Metal-arm / Hose Manifold Connections / Cargo Hose

Terminal personnel generally connect to the vessel's manifold. The ship's crew shall attend to remove blanks and assist as requested.

The OOW shall supervise the connection and verify that:

- Where supports or jacks are used for the loading arms, they should be fitted directly onto the deck or other substantial support. They should never be placed onto fixtures or fittings that are not capable of supporting the load.

- All cargo and bunker pipelines which are not in use should be securely blanked at the manifold. Blank flanges should withstand the working pressure of the line or system they are connected to and be as thick as the end flange they are fitted to.

- All drain and sampling lines which are not in use should be fitted with blanks or caps.

- A bolt should be fitted in every hole, then tightened correctly and evenly.

- Nuts and bolts should be of the correct size and material. Damaged bolts should not be used.

Note: Bolts should be long enough to protrude through the nuts, to the other side, by at least 3 more threads. This is valid for any ship-shore manifold connection and any other blank flange used to cover any manifold connections (cargo, bunker, lube oil, sludge, sewage, etc.).

Caution: Improvised arrangements using G-clamps or similar devices are not permitted.

Ship’s crew normally connects and disconnects hoses at a buoy mooring or STS operation, using equipment supplied by the terminal or the STS Provider. In these cases:

- Lifting bridles and saddles should be provided.

- The use of steel wires in direct contact with the hose cover should be avoided.

- Certified lifting straps should be used; they should be positioned so that the hose does not fold over on itself (sharp kinks in the hoses should be avoided).

- Lifting equipment should be appropriately sized to accommodate the weight of the hose when full of product.

- Straps should be placed strategically to allow the flange to align horizontally; this will improve hose connection efficiency.

- Excessive weight on the ship’s manifold should be avoided.

- Adequate support for the hose, when connected to the manifold, should be provided.

- Where this support is via a single lifting point, such as the hose handling crane, the hose string should be supported by bridles or webbing straps.

If the vessel uses its own cargo hoses, carry out a hose pressure test annually.

The test pressure should be 1.5 times the working pressure. Stencil the hose with the date of testing and max/min service temperature. Maintain the records in the PMS.

Note: Tankers in the Fleet are not provided with portable Cargo Transfer Hoses

Draining any product from the loading arms or hoses into open drip-trays should be avoided. The contents of portable or fixed drip-trays should be transferred to a slop tank or other safe container.

Manifold drip trays should be clean and free from cargo residues. Good practice is to place portable drip-trays under each connection to catch any leaks.

Caution: Do not use plastic and other non-metallic containers.

The midships cargo hose handling crane(s) should not be used while cargo operations are in progress without Terminal’s approval.

####### Vapor manifolds

The first inboard meter of each cargo vapor manifold connection should have its exterior surfaces painted, with the exception of the flange faces.

The painted area should be divided into three bands, with the outboard and inboard bands being red in color and 100mm wide and the center being yellow.

In addition, the word VAPOUR should be painted in black letters, at least 50mm high, on both the forward and aft sides of all reducers, both main and reserve, in approximately the 2 o’clock and 10 o’clock positions.

To prevent the possible misconnection of the vapor manifold to a liquid loading line, a mechanical keying arrangement is provided for vapor manifold presentation flanges as follows:

- The bolt locations should be arranged so that two bolts straddle the 12 o’clock position at the top of the flange face

- One cylindrical stud should be permanently attached to each of the presentation flange faces at the 12 o’clock position on the flange bolt circles

- Never use designated vapor reducers for cargo manifolds connection and vice versa.

###### Ship / Shore Bonding Cables

- A ship/shore bonding cable is not effective as a safety device.

- If a bonding cable is insisted upon by the terminal, fit it in full compliance with ISGOTT requirements.

###### Accommodation Access

Keep all external doors, ports, and windows closed in the accommodation block.

Designate only one door for routine access to and from the exterior deck, preferably the offshore side door. Mark this door clearly with ENTRANCE/EXIT signs to avoid confusion.

While in port, deck crew should carry out hourly checks to ensure all other doors are closed and report to CCR.

####### IG System

Before cargo operations the responsible Officers / Engineers must check the IG system as follows:

Visual inspection and check operation of the IG deck isolation valve.

Inspect the deck seal for:

Water supply

Drain valve open

Correct water level

Operation of Deck Seal alarms

Operation of high- and low-level alarms

Operation of the IG main non-return flap valve

Water-level in the pressure/vacuum breaker

Operation of all IGS control equipment including high temperature, high- and low-pressure alarms, and the high oxygen alarm

Operation of the fixed oxygen analyzer and remote readout in the cargo control room

Refer further to Chapter 8.1.5 – Inert Gas Management.

##### Pumproom Entry

The OOW is responsible for these procedures:

Comply with ISGOTT guidelines

Inspect the pumproom regularly during cargo operations

Note: Treat the pumproom as an enclosed space.

Conduct a risk assessment and obtain a permit for pumproom entry

Caution: Permit is invalid if ventilation is interrupted, or conditions change. Validity shall not exceed 12 hours.

Before personnel enter the pumproom:

Operate ventilation at lower suction for at least 30 minutes before entry

Check atmosphere for oxygen content, hydrocarbons, and toxic gases (e.g., CO, H2S, benzene)

Ensure fixed gas sampling equipment is in use

Ensure lighting is operational

Equip personnel with portable gas monitoring and communication equipment

Rig and ready rescue harness and lifeline with guide wire

Obtain permission from OOW on the bridge or CCR

Switch on Dead-Man alarm for single man entry

Inspect hourly:

Lines and pumps

Pump casing and bearing temperatures

Pumproom bilge sounding

Record inspection results in the port (cargo) logbook

Refer further to Chapter 5.3.2 – Entry into Enclosed Space

##### Pumproom Bilges

Pump room bilges should be kept and maintained clean and dry.

Storage of oil / substances in pump room likely to spontaneously ignite or emanate vapors shall be avoided.

Any water/oil discovered in the pump room bilges must be removed and disposed of as soon as possible.

Pump room bilges shall be transferred to slop tanks using the stripping pump.

By design, the stripping pump shall be possible to operate remotely by controlling it and the bilge suction and discharge valves from the upper deck.

If a bilge suction is provided from stripping pump, a stop check valve shall be fitted in the suction branch.

Bilge suction valve(s) should be NRV type, not to allow oil/water from lines to flow back into the bilge.

Always keep bilge suction valve(s) “open”.

Stripping pump and bilge disposal arrangements shall be maintained/tested periodically as per maker’s instructions and records kept in company’s PMS.

Test P/R bilge high level alarms weekly and before any cargo operation.

Pumping pumproom bilges in case of flooding

In case of accidental flooding of pump room bilges do the following:

- Stop cargo pump/ballast pump, if running

- Isolate P/R piping system from rest of cargo/ballast piping system by closing the main isolation valves to stop progressive flooding.

- Change pump room flooding damper suction to “high” intake

- Line up stripping pump to transfer bilges to slop tanks.

Note: operate stripping pump’s steam and suction/discharge valves remotely from CCR/upper deck

- Start the stripping pump

- Follow EMER C/L 14, as applicable

- Pump room bilges transfer should be recorded in ORB part II under section “O”.

- Completed

Note: For smaller vessels, the Master decides on the minimum duty personnel.

Complete and post form TANK 14 before cargo transfer operations.

Notify Operations and Personnel departments if additional personnel are needed.

###### Accommodation Air Conditioning and Ventilation Systems

Set air conditioning intakes to maintain positive pressure inside the accommodation. Do not use full recirculation to avoid pressure drop. If gas is detected, switch to recirculation and stop extraction fans.

###### Signals

Display appropriate international and local day and night signals during cargo operations.

##### Operation Tools

###### Tank High Level Alarm and Tank Overfill Alarm

Each vessel shall be fitted with:

Remote cargo ullage measurement systems (Tank radar or tank floating gauges)

Manual cargo measuring equipment (UTI or MMC)

A tank overfill alarm system:

Note: This system shall give an audible and visual alarm in the CCR and on deck if the tank reaches 98% of its volume.

A tank high-level alarm system:

Note: This system shall give an audible and visual alarm, at least in the CCR, if the tank reaches 95% of its volume.

Operational Use:

Monitor liquid levels in cargo tanks.

Provide early warning of levels close to the permitted tank filling capacity.

Testing:

Test “high level” and “overfill” alarm systems before arriving at the loading or discharging port and at regular intervals as per PMS.

Maintain operational status during the entire cargo transfer process.

Note: Refer to instruction manuals and PMS for maintenance routines and inspections of high-level and overfill alarms.

Ensure adequate control of liquid levels during cargo operations and critical stages, such as topping off or stripping.

Loading: Reduce the rate in sufficient time before topping off tanks.

Discharging: Ensure tanks are de-bottomed (below 95% of tank’s volume) early in the operation to keep alarms functional.

If an alarm sensor fails, the Chief Officer shall conduct a risk assessment and implement alternative liquid level monitoring methods.

###### Use of Portable Ullage Measuring Equipment

Every vessel is provided with four portable ullage measuring devices (UTI or MMC) for measuring the level and temperature of liquid in the tanks through a closed system method. Each instrument shall be serviced and calibrated ashore yearly, with a calibration certificate valid for one year.

During Operations:

- Reduce loading rate during topping off and use portable ullage tapes to verify liquid levels.

- Use vessel’s portable measuring devices for tank surveys before discharging cargo and after loading. If the independent cargo surveyor uses their tape, the vessel must:

- Conduct and record measurements using the vessel’s tape.

- Issue a note of protest to the surveyor.

Note: Ship’s figures must be based on the vessel’s tape measurements.

##### Cargo Measurements

There are three methods of gauging tanks: Closed, Open, and Restricted.

###### Closed gauging

This method uses a gauging device that penetrates the cargo tank but is part of a closed system, maintaining complete cargo containment integrity. It is designed and installed to prevent the release of cargo liquid or vapor to the atmosphere. These are fixed tank gauging systems.

###### Open gauging

This method uses an opening in the cargo tank, such as a gauge hatch or ullage port, which may expose the user to the cargo and its vapors.

Caution: This method is not allowed in our fleet and should be avoided.

If requested by charterers, cargo surveyors, or terminals, immediately inform the office and seek clarification.

###### Restricted Gauging

This method uses a gauging device that penetrates the cargo tank and can release small quantities of cargo vapor or liquid during operation. The release is controlled by a small diameter tank penetration opening and a locally operated valve (vapor lock) or similar closure device. When not in use, this type of gauging device is closed to maintain cargo containment integrity.

When using the restricted method for gauging by UTI/MMC, avoid escaping vapours and wear proper PPE (refer to Company PPE Matrix) if there is a risk of gas exposure. Stand at right angles to the wind direction to avoid a back eddy of vapours. Depending on the cargo, consider using appropriate RPE (respiratory protective equipment).

Restricted gauging is only allowed when there are means to relieve tank pressure to safe limits before introducing a UTI for gauging. Verify the accuracy of the fixed tank level and temperature monitoring system against independent measuring devices (UTIs/MMC) during every cargo operation and record using form TANK 26.

UTI/MMC should always be bonded to the ship's metal structure before being introduced into the tank and remain bonded until fully removed. This applies to both inerted and non-inerted tanks to eliminate the risk of spark discharges between metal objects that might be electrically insulated.

Note: Refer to Ch 8.1.10 - Special Cargoes / Ullaging, Dipping, Sampling in Non-Inerted Tanks for procedures when handling static accumulator cargoes.

At some terminals, a cargo surveyor might insist on using another UTI/MMC that is not the ship’s property. In such cases, request the latest certificate of shore calibration from the cargo surveyor. Note in the ship’s official ullage report that another UTI was used for gauging and record the UTI serial number. Conduct parallel gauging of cargo tanks using the ship’s certified UTI/MMC to avoid cargo quantity discrepancies.

##### Cargo Sampling

There are two methods of sampling cargo tanks: Open and Closed.

###### Open Sampling

Open sampling should generally be avoided.

This method contains risks of exposing personnel to harmful cargo vapours and electrostatic hazards.

Caution: Seek clarification from the office if open sampling is requested by third parties.

If open sampling is allowed, conduct a full risk assessment considering cargo characteristics, personal exposure to toxic/flammable vapours, electrostatic hazards, and weather conditions. Ensure appropriate PPE, including RPE, meets the risk assessment requirements.

Note: Refer to BP “Open Sampling & Additivisation Procedure” (Operations Dept. will provide).

###### Closed Sampling

When using the closed sampling method, avoid escaping vapor and wear proper PPE (refer to Company PPE Matrix) if there is a risk of gas exposure. Stand at right angles to the wind direction to avoid a back eddy of vapor. Depending on the cargo, consider using appropriate RPE.

Sampling is only allowed when there are means to relieve tank pressure to safe limits before introducing the sampler into the tank.

Samplers should always be bonded to the ship's metal structure before being introduced into the tank and remain bonded until fully removed. This applies to both inerted and non-inerted tanks to eliminate the risk of spark discharges between metal objects that might be electrically insulated.

Note: Refer to Ch 8.1.10 - Special Cargoes / Ullaging, Dipping, Sampling in Non-Inerted Tanks for procedures when handling static accumulator cargoes.

Cargo buyers require to assess the quality of cargo contained in ship’s tanks. They use surveyors or request the vessel’s staff to collect some cargo samples from the tanks. Use the below guidelines:

- Reduce the tank inert gas pressure to +/- 100mm WG to facilitate closed sampling.

- Use equipment specially supplied to your vessel for drawing samples from closed cargo tanks.

- Ensure the equipment is properly grounded when the sampling device is lowered into the tank.

- Open and close the valve with care, to avoid damage to the equipment.

###### Handling Cargo Samples - Procedure and Precautions

Take samples of each grade of cargo at the following points when loading:

First stream at the ship’s manifold

First foot in the cargo tank

Loaded (completed) tank

Use personal protective equipment during sample handling. Use a special chemical-resistant outfit when handling corrosive and toxic cargoes (e.g., Caustic Soda, Phenol, Acrylonitrile). Use appropriate PPE as necessary when drawing samples, per the product’s MSDS.

When drawing toxic cargo samples:

Wear respiratory equipment

Follow a closed sample method

Note: In compliance with IBC Code venting and gauging regulations (IBC Ch.13 and Ch. 17).

Take samples of each grade at the ship’s manifold to ensure the first stream of incoming cargo is free of contamination. If possible, load the smallest tank first to take the first foot sample.

Note: If any irregularity is observed, in this way only a small amount of cargo will be affected.

The cargo surveyor and ship’s cargo officer shall take cargo samples from every loaded tank. Label and seal the samples. Take samples in non-inerted tanks only after a “rest” period of at least 30 minutes has passed.

Retain samples on board for at least 13 months or as per charterer requirements, whichever is greater, after discharging the cargo.

Store the samples:

In lockers not accessible from the accommodation.

In an area protected by fire detection and fixed firefighting systems, such as a paint locker or midship storeroom.

Away from high temperatures and direct sunlight.

The sample room (compartment, box) shall be locked and well ventilated. Construct cell boxes of material resistant to the chemicals stored (preferably metal).

Before entering any storage space, ensure it is properly ventilated.

Samples shall be:

Marked with port, date & time, grade, MARPOL category, and tank or manifold number.

Properly sealed and recorded in the sample logbook.

Placed in a separate cell of the box to avoid losses through movement.

Stowed away from each other if incompatible.

Accompanied by an MSDS.

Checked frequently for leakage.

Note: See IBC Code section 16.5 and USCG compatibility chart for correct stowage of chemical samples.

Dispose of cargo samples after their retention period, provided the cargo is not the subject of any claim.

###### Cargo Sample Disposal

Dispose of cargo samples per current MARPOL regulations. Preferably, dispose of cargo samples ashore to appropriate reception facilities against a signed sample receipt.

Cargo samples of MARPOL Cat. X and high viscosity/solidified cargoes MARPOL Cat. Y or any cargo samples of products requiring a prewash shall be landed ashore to reception facilities.

Note: Make an entry in the sample log and attach the sample receipt.

Alternatively, mix the cargo sample with other slops or tank wash water of the same MARPOL category as the sample. Ensure their compatibility with the USCG compatibility chart. If in doubt about the disposal of cargo samples, seek clarification from the office.

Note: Post a copy of the disposal procedure in the cargo sample locker.

##### Emergency Shut Down

####### Ship Emergency Stops:

Each tanker vessel is equipped with ESD controls for cargo pumps, activated from multiple locations (e.g., manifolds, CCR, pump room entrance).

The Chief Officer is responsible for:

Testing ESD controls from all locations before cargo transfer.

Maintaining records of test, inspection, and maintenance of all ESD controls per PMS and instruction manual.

Familiarizing the crew with cargo system shutdown controls and activation circumstances.

####### Ship-Shore ESD:

Linked ESD systems for oil and chemical transfers, including STS transfers, are recommended by OCIMF and CDI.

ESD systems ensure safe cargo transfer shutdown in abnormal conditions (e.g., high tank level, high/low tank pressures, fire, gas detection, excessive manifold movement).

The ESD system allows either party to activate a controlled shutdown, protecting against pressure surges.

OCIMF and CDI recommend a standard 5-pin twist connector for tanker-terminal ESD link.

Testing: Test the ESD system before arrival at each discharge port and record in the logbook.

Contingency Plan: If an ESD link is not fitted, have a contingency plan and risk assessment for emergency cargo system shutdown.

Consider the advice given in the OCIMF publication: Linked-Ship-Shore-Emergency-Shutdown-Systems-for-Oil-and-Chemical-Transfers (Ch. 16.1A).

####### Reference

- OCIMF-Linked-Ship-Shore-Emergency-Shutdown-Systems-for-Oil-and-Chemical-Transfers (Ch. 16.1A)

###### Pigging Operation

Pigging is a line-clearing process where a 'pig', typically a rubber sphere or cylinder, is pushed through the line by a liquid or compressed gas.

A pig can be used to:

clear the line completely, usually propelled by water or gas, or

to clear the line from a previous, likely propelled by the next grade.

A common arrangement for catching the “pig” involves the shore terminal providing a “pig receiver”, mounted outboard of the ship's manifold, from which the “pig” can be removed. A pressure of about 2.7 bar (40 psi) is considered the minimum necessary to drive the pig, but pressures up to 7 bar (100 psi) may be used.

Before any pigging operations, the Chief Officer and the terminal representative should agree on the procedures and associated safeguards, discussing:

The propelling gas or liquid volumes

Pressures

Time required for the pig to travel along the line

Volume of residual cargo in the line

The amount of ullage space available

The pig getting stuck in the line will be indicated by:

Monitoring the pressure upstream of the pig

Failure of the pig to arrive within the expected time period

On completion of the pigging operation, the terminal should verify that the pig has arrived. Bleed off any residual pressure in the shoreline before opening the pig trap or removing cargo arms or hoses. Personnel at the receiving end should be aware of possible sediment in the pig receiver unit and have means in place to deal with it, such as rags, absorbent material, and drums.

Keep appropriate IGS operational records during the pigging operation.



### 8.1.10 Special Cargoes - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Handling Specialized Oil Cargoes

###### Heated Cargoes

####### Introduction

Charterers typically specify the temperature at which the cargo will be:

- Loaded

- Maintained during the voyage

- Discharged

The maximum loading temperature is 157°F/69.5°C.

Note: Higher temperatures may cause damage to coatings and valve seats, as well as thermal shock.

Voyage orders often require the application of heating at the start of a lengthy voyage, even though there is ample time to reach the required discharge temperature by starting to heat much later in the loaded passage.

It may be prudent to heat early as instructed by charterers rather than later in the voyage, with the attendant risk of failing to reach the required temperature before arrival.

Do not expose the vessel and owners to the risk of breaching charter party requirements due to delaying heating to economize on fuel consumption.

If uncertain, seek clarification from the charterers and keep the office fully informed.

####### Loading of Heated Cargoes

The following shall be taken into consideration when carrying heated cargoes:

- Consider the heating coil capacity for each tank while preparing the loading plan.

- Complete heating coil pressure tests and essential maintenance before arrival at the load port. Drain the coils and check for any sign of oil contamination.

- Test heating coils, heaters, and heat exchangers in accordance with the instruction manual yearly, as per PMS.

- The master shall consult the office whenever the temperature of the cargo requested to be loaded is more than 60°C.

- Spread the cargo throughout the ship as evenly as possible to dissipate the heat and avoid local heat stress.

- Ensure that tanks and pipelines are completely free of water before receiving any cargo with a temperature above the boiling point of water.

- If the cargo to be loaded requires heating during the voyage, the integrity of the heating system should be inspected and tested for tightness before loading starts.

- If no heating is required, it is recommended that the heating coils are blown through and blanked. Drain and blank the common heater or the individual heat exchangers (where fitted).

- If the heating medium is incompatible with the cargo to be loaded, the system must be blown through, and the coils blanked before loading.

- Allow for cargo expansion as a result of heating during the passage to the discharge port.

- If feasible, remove or reduce any waxy sludge by thorough crude oil washing at the preceding discharge port.

- Raise the cargo temperature slowly to avoid overheating. Overheating will prolong the settling down period.

- As soon as loading is finished, or if the operation is suspended for long periods, strip the lines used for loading before their contents begin to solidify.

- Open stripping pump strainers and clean them out after line-stripping operations.

####### Control of Temperature during the Laden Passage

The rate of temperature change in any tank depends on:

- The volume of oil it contains

- The quantity of heating applied

- Tank location and local conditions

- Check the thermometers in use for accuracy.

- Check tank temperatures twice daily at upper, middle, and lower levels. Record in the cargo temperature log, form TANK 49, together with the sea temperature and weather.

- Set temperature alarms on the tank monitoring system as appropriate for the cargo carried, to avoid overheating.

- Record temperatures also for tanks loaded with non-heated cargo adjacent to cargo tanks loaded with heated cargo to exclude the possibility of overflowing due to thermal expansion.

- Maintain the steam pressure in heating coils according to instruction manual guidance.

- Use the indicated temperature trend and rate of change in known conditions to decide if heating adjustments are necessary.

There are two ways of controlling the temperature of the cargo during the loaded passage:

- Maintaining a Specific Temperature Throughout:

- For high pour point crude (HPPC), the required temperature will be the pour point of the crude plus an allowance to prevent it from solidifying.

- Heat sufficiently only to reach the specified carriage/discharge temperature with minimum fuel consumption.

Note: Excessive heating will increase fuel consumption and may cause vaporization of cargo light elements.

- Leaving the Cargo Unheated at the Start of the Voyage:

This method can save fuel because of a shorter heating period.

Start heating in sufficient time to reach the discharge port with the cargo at the temperature stipulated in the charter party and/or voyage instructions.

Risks associated with the timing of the start of heating include:

- The characteristics of the crude

- The expected weather

- Sea temperature throughout the passage

- The vessel's heating capacity

Suspension of heating could cause layering and solidification at the tank bottom, impeding or preventing further cargo discharge.

####### Discharging of Heated Cargoes

The following shall be complied with when discharging heated cargoes:

- Heat the cargo to the temperature specified by the charterer or consignee.

- Consider the pour point plus 20°C to 25°C as a suitable discharge temperature range.

- If discharging more than one grade of oil, segregate pumps and pipelines as far as circumstances permit. Minimize contamination by draining pumps and pipelines before changing to a different grade.

- If possible, discharge high pour point crude (HPPC) or high viscosity crude (HVC) parcels first to avoid the risk of blocking lines with solidified cargo.

- Adjust the supply of steam to the heating coils as the cargo level falls in a tank. Once the tank level falls below the heating coils, the cargo will begin to cool, particularly in winter conditions with low sea temperatures.

- To minimize the risk of solidification, ensure that the cargo is appropriately heated before stripping begins and that the stripping operation is done quickly. Discharge as much cargo as possible using the main cargo pump to minimize stripping time.

- If any cargo solidifies between the heating coils and the tank bottom, transfer heated crude from another tank and increase coil heating to re-liquefy it.

- If any solidification of line contents occurs, try to re-liquefy it by recirculating part of the cargo discharge back into a suitable tank via the drop lines. Use only one tank for this purpose and keep a close check on the tank ullage.

- Alternatively, connect a steam hose from the tank cleaning heater to the manifold drain line to apply heat directly to the solidified oil.

####### Ballasting Operation with Heated Cargo

Consider the possibility of solidification of heated cargo before starting the ballasting operation. Take the following precautions:

- Maintain the cargo temperature at the maximum permitted to aid with discharge.

- Carry out the ballasting operation progressively to avoid sudden temperature changes in adjacent cargo tanks.

- Stow heated cargo preferably in center tanks (where applicable), provided that the vessel remains within acceptable limits of stress.

- When all tanks are loaded with heated cargo, plan the discharge to avoid the cargo falling below its pour point.

- Discharge side tanks first before taking in ballast (where applicable).

Note: Overheating cargo could affect its quality. Seek advice from the company before raising the cargo temperature.

####### Precautions with Cargoes that Might Solidify

Note: High viscous liquid left inside a closed piping system can create severe damage to the system or cause leakage/rupture of gaskets, expansion joints, or flanges due to expansion inside, as the liquid temperature rises. Damage on cargo system on deck could cause oil pollution, and if it occurs inside tanks, it might trigger cargo contamination (e.g., bottom cargo pipelines, pump room pipelines, top loading lines, small diameter lines, including COW lines, etc.).

Observe the following to avoid such damage:

- Include instructions in the cargo oil transfer plan on how to displace oil cargo in the lines upon completion of transfer operations. Discuss this with shore facility representatives.

- Do not leave cargo oil in the deck or pump room cargo piping upon completion of cargo oil transfer operations. Drop the cargo oil into the cargo tanks.

- Pay close attention to cargo bottom lines containing non-heated cargo that pass through tanks loaded with heated cargo.

- When proceeding to warmer regions, thermal expansion of ballast water inside pump room lines can cause leakages at flanges.

- Take preventive measures against solidification inside tanks and pipelines after heated cargo is loaded or discharged.

- Consider stripping bottom lines, particularly near empty cargo tanks, after completion of operations.

Note: Air in closed systems is more easily compressed and causes less damage than liquid trapped in a closed system.

###### High Viscosity Crude Oils (HVC)

High viscosity crude oils does not solidify at ambient temperature but is difficult to discharge due to its high viscosity.

The viscosity of oil increases with a decrease in temperature and vice versa.

A centrifugal cargo pump can discharge cargo at up to 1000 cSt.

However, to reduce damage to the pump mechanical seal and ensure smooth operation, reduce viscosity to less than 500 cSt.

###### Heavy Fuel Oil

- Clean tanks assigned for the carriage of fuel oil, following a previous cargo of crude oil.

- This will involve a hot or cold wash of tanks to be loaded.

- Obtain clear instructions on tank preparation from the owners.

- If the vessel is instructed to load a cargo comprising both fuel and crude oil parcels, consult with operations department.

- Load and discharge the heavy fuel and crude oil consignments fully segregated.

- If instructed to use one or more lines or pumps for both parcels, obtain advance agreement from the owners.

- Drain the lines and pumps between grades to minimize the risk of contamination of the fuel oil parcel.

###### High Vapour Pressure Crude Oils (HVPC)

Crude oils in this category have a true vapor pressure (TVP) up to 0.7 bar (10 PSIA) and tend to experience vapor loss during carriage.

Observe the following precautions during loading:

- Avoid loading when the wind velocity is less than five knots.

- Ensure a very low initial flow rate into tanks.

- Ensure very low topping-off rates.

- Avoid creating a partial vacuum in the loading line.

- Maintain closed loading.

- Monitor gas dispersion and ensure compliance with all safety requirements.

- Large volumes of gas may be released from HVPC cargoes after loading is completed or when the vessel begins her sea passage.

- Monitor tank pressures carefully. Take contingency measures to ensure that the gas can be released safely.

Observe the following precautions during discharging:

- Reduce the speed of the MCPs in sufficient time to prevent cavitation and loss of pump suction at low tank levels.

- Bleed off gas from MCP casings as necessary.

- Pressurize the cargo tanks with inert gas to raise the suction head of the cargo pump(s).

- Stagger the completion of tanks because stripping is more critical with crudes of this kind, often requiring pump priming from tanks with a greater head of cargo.

If a parcel of heavier crude or one with a low vapor pressure is also carried, the Master shall consider to request permission from the charterer through owners to draw from this parcel when pumping HVPC at low tank levels and when stripping. The resultant blend should pump better, prolong the use of the MCPs, and minimize any un-pumpable HVPC remaining on board.

As far as possible, HVPC should be loaded in tanks chosen to maintain the carriage temperature, assist cooling, and facilitate efficient pumping according to circumstances, observing the following general guidelines:

- Use center tanks for a summer zone discharge port (if applicable).

- Use wing tanks for a winter zone discharge port.

- Use after tanks for proximity to the pumps.

##### Properties and Hazards of Petroleum

###### Toxic Hazards of Crude Oil

Crude oils differ depending on their origin but generally contain:

Carbon: 83 to 87%

Hydrogen: 11 to 14%

Sulfur: 5% or less

Nitrogen: 0.4% or less

Oxygen: 0.5% or less

Metals: 0.5% or less

Crude oil contains gases such as:

- Methane

- Ethane

- Hydrogen sulfide

During loading, hydrocarbon gases within the cargo are released into the ullage space. The effects of petroleum gas on humans can vary widely.

Inhalation can lead to:

Light-headedness

Drunkenness

Dizziness

Death, if large quantities of gas are inhaled

The odour of crude oil gas mixtures varies and can paralyze the sense of smell, especially with hydrogen sulphide gas. Toxic gas may be present even if there is no odour.

##### Toxic Hazards of Hydrogen Sulfide

###### Cargoes with High Concentrations of H2S (≥ 5 Ppm)

When handling cargoes with H2S content of more than 5 ppm in the vapor phase:

Keep venting velocity high, especially in calm wind conditions.

Stop cargo loading if there is no wind to disperse vapors or if the wind direction carries vapors towards the accommodation.

Restrict access to the open deck to personnel actively engaged in vessel security and cargo handling.

If closed measurements and sampling are not possible, personnel involved shall wear breathing apparatus.

Escort visitors to and from accommodation spaces.

Brief visitors on cargo hazards and emergency procedures.

In ship-to-ship transfers, consider freeboard differences and ensure vapors are dispersed away from accommodation spaces.

Monitor exposure levels in all work locations, on the bridge, in the control room, in accommodation, and in engine spaces.

Operate ventilation systems to prevent H2S vapors from entering accommodation and engine spaces.

Personnel engaged in cargo operations should carry personal H2S gas monitoring instruments with alarms set at 5 ppm.

Precautions in case H2S gas detector alarm is activated (gas concentration above 5 ppm):

Deck duty personnel should clear the area and inform CCR.

One deckhand shall be ready to wear breathing apparatus and stand by at the manifold for instructions.

The OOW shall inform the Chief Officer, who will take necessary actions (i.e. stop cargo operation, slow down the rate, etc.)

###### Sour Crude Oils

Crude oils containing more than 50 ppm of hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) are defined as sour crudes.

Hydrogen sulphide is usually removed from crude oil before shipment, but some grades may still contain substantial quantities.

Loading terminals exporting oil with high H2S concentrations usually notify the vessel of analysis results.

H2S has a low boiling point, evaporates early during loading, and accumulates in the ullage space due to its low density.

H2S is very toxic. Effects of inhalation at various concentrations are:

700 – 1000 ppm: Rapid unconsciousness, "knockdown" or immediate collapse within one or two breaths, breathing stops, death within minutes.

1000-2000 ppm: Nearly instant death.

At around 1 ppm, H2S can be recognized by its rotten egg odour.

However, it quickly impairs the sense of smell, which can be fatal in increasing concentrations.

The absence of smell should never be taken to indicate the absence of gas.

It is important to distinguish between concentrations of H2S in the atmosphere (ppm by volume) and in liquid (ppm by weight).

For example, crude oil containing 70 ppm (by weight) H2S can produce a concentration of 7000 ppm (by volume) in the gas stream leaving an ullage port.

Predicting vapor concentration from liquid concentration is not possible. For H2S, the exposure limit is 5 ppm for OEL-TWA 8h per day or 40h per week.

Note: Any 1 ppm of H₂S in liquid form contained in the cargo would yield approximately 100-150 ppm H₂S in gas form in the ullage space of the tank.

Caution: Significant levels of H₂S can also be present in other cargoes, such as condensate or naphtha.

High levels of hydrogen sulphide are normally reduced by stabilization process before the crude is delivered to the vessel. However, regardless the stabilization process, some crude oils remain very high in H₂S content.

Instability of this type of crude oil can result in the release of large quantities of H₂S gas, which sometimes should be vented to control tank pressures. This gas is both toxic and explosive and constitutes an extreme hazard to the safety of personnel and the vessel, as listed below:

- H₂S gas is heavier than air and sinks to the deck in light air conditions.

- Air currents and eddies around the vessel may result in gas collecting in or near the accommodation or in enclosed spaces.

- Personnel who accidentally enter these pockets of highly toxic gas may suffer instantaneous collapse and cessation of breathing.

Observe the following safety precautions when handling sour crude:

- Confirm that all tank lids, ullage ports, and tank cleaning openings on the main deck are gas-tight before arrival at the loading port.

- Ensure that tanks P/V valves are gas-tight and operating at designed pressure settings.

- Use closed cargo handling procedures (closed loading devices where fitted) and check the portable gauging equipment before arrival to ensure it is working correctly.

- Prevent personnel exposure to H₂S gas using approved instruments for detecting and measuring its concentration.

- Personnel must work in pairs on the tank deck and be provided with EEBDs and personal H₂S gas detectors.

- Personnel shall be required to wear breathing apparatus when:

Permissible exposure limits (PEL) are exceeded.

Monitoring cannot be carried out.

Closed operations cannot be conducted and H₂S gas concentrations could exceed the PEL.

- Before loading, brief all crew members on the dangers of hydrogen sulphide and the precautions that must be followed during the entire operation.

- Before arrival at the loading port, pressure test the IGS to ensure there are no leaks. Every part of the system, including but not limited to deck seals, branch lines, high-velocity vents, and p/v valves, must be checked, and any leaks stopped.

- Display posters and notices alerting crew members to the dangers of hydrogen sulphide gas around the accommodation.

- Place SCBA in the vicinity of the manifold and resuscitation equipment ready for use in the accommodation.

- Regard the following areas as hazardous during loading and discharging. Control unauthorized access to below gas hazardous areas:

Tank deck

Pumproom

All areas other than the interior of the accommodation block and engine room

- Prevent the entry of toxic gas into the accommodation and engine room. Keep the doors and other openings closed and check at regular intervals.

- Select the air intakes for the ventilation of these spaces to prevent the entry of toxic gas.

- If there is any sign that H₂S gas is being drawn in, operate the ventilation system on full recirculation and stop all extraction fans.

- Draw up ship-specific plans for dealing with this contingency and test them during regular practice drills.

- Vent gas from the mast riser in a controlled manner so that, whenever possible, the hydrogen sulphide gas is quickly cleared from the tank deck.

- If concentrations exceed 10 ppm in the accommodation, or 50 ppm at positions more than 3m from a gas venting outlet, reduce the loading rate. If this does not result in a significant improvement in local gas levels, stop loading until conditions are found to be acceptable.

- Avoid loading through the pumproom to eliminate the risk of H₂S contamination of that space.

- Operate the pumproom fans for 30 minutes and test the atmosphere for gas before permitting entry.

- Take great care when draining hoses or hard arms to prevent the escape of cargo liquid or gas.

- Cargo pumps, stripping pumps, and other cargo equipment may also contain H₂S gas. Opening these units or using their gas bleed devices could release high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide gas.

- Pyrophoric iron sulphide deposits are formed when hydrogen sulphide reacts with rusted surfaces in the absence of oxygen. These deposits can heat to burning when coming into contact with air. Always ensure that cargo tanks are inerted and with oxygen content less than 8% Vol.

- During cargo measurements, sampling, dipping cargo tanks, reduce tank pressures to a minimum consistent with safe procedures. Personnel carrying out this operation shall stand upwind of the tank openings, clear of any gas discharge from the tank.

- While on passage, if tank venting is required, alter the course to put the wind on the beam to ensure that the vented gas is blown clear of the tank deck.

After completing discharge, the cargo tanks will contain a high concentration of hydrogen sulphide gas, which can be purged with IG. It may be necessary to wash cargo tanks to remove all traces of gas, particularly if there are accumulations of sludge in the tanks.

Some loading terminals require ships to water-wash cargo tanks following the discharge of a high H₂S cargo before they can be accepted. Masters shall establish appropriate procedures well in advance if this degree of preparation is required for the next loading.

##### Cargoes with Benzene and Aromatic Hydrocarbons

Aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzene, toluene, and xylene, are present in many petroleum cargoes such as gasoline, reformates, naphtha, solvents, turpentine substitutes, white spirits, and crude oil.

Although the health hazards of aromatic hydrocarbons are not fully established, personnel should follow the precautions and procedures outlined below to minimize exposure during cargo handling.

The OEL of aromatic hydrocarbon vapor is generally lower than that of other hydrocarbons.

The IMO MSC Circular 1095/2003 establishes requirements for ships carrying liquids with 0.5% or more benzene, covering:

Cargo information transfer

Occupational exposure limits

Air quality monitoring

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

PPE maintenance

Enclosed space entry

Training

Medical monitoring

Ship/shore connection

Precautions during cargo operations

Tank venting

Cargo measurement and sampling

Contaminated clothes

While the MSC Circular refers to benzene cargoes listed in MARPOL Annex I, some precautions are also defined by MARPOL Annex II and the IBC and BCH Codes. The following guidance uses the operational exposure limits from the MSC Circular and provides advice for MARPOL Annex I tankers carrying cargoes with lower benzene concentrations.

Benzene is primarily an inhalation hazard, with poor warning qualities as its odour threshold is above the OEL-TWA. Chronic exposure to low concentrations can cause leukemia, while exposure above 1,000 ppm can lead to unconsciousness and death. Benzene can also be absorbed through the skin and is toxic if ingested.

Cargoes containing benzene should be handled using closed operation procedures to reduce exposure. Use a vapor emission control system ashore if available.

Master should verify the closed loading system's effectiveness in reducing benzene vapor concentrations on the working deck through surveys during operations like loading, discharging, sampling, hose handling, tank cleaning, gas freeing, and gauging.

Determine vapor concentrations when tank cleaning, venting, or ballasting tanks previously containing benzene. Ship’s personnel should perform spot checks using detector tubes, toxic analyzers, or electronic detectors to ascertain if OEL-TWAs are exceeded, necessitating PPE use.

Minimize exposure when measuring and sampling benzene-containing cargoes. The IMO MSC Circular sets the OEL-TWA for benzene at 1 ppm over eight hours. Working procedures should aim for the lowest possible gas concentrations at work locations.

###### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Personnel should wear respiratory protective equipment when:

Exposed to benzene vapours above the OEL-TWA

National or international OELs are likely to be exceeded

Monitoring is not possible

Closed operations cannot be conducted

Before entering a tank that has carried benzene-containing petroleum products, test for benzene concentrations in addition to enclosed space entry requirements.

###### Preparation for Tank Entry

To ensure toxic components of inert gas are below their OELs, continue gas freeing until an oxygen analyser shows a steady reading of 20.9% oxygen by volume and a flammable gas indicator shows no more than 1% LFL.

If toxic gas presence (e.g., benzene or hydrogen sulphide) is suspected, continue gas freeing until concentrations are below OEL.

Maintain positive fresh air ventilation during personnel presence in a tank, frequently testing oxygen and hydrocarbon content.

Be alert for inert gas leaks into the gas-free tank from adjacent or interconnected tanks (e.g., through bulkhead fractures or defective valves), minimized by maintaining positive inert gas pressure. When reconnecting a gas-free tank to the inert gas main, immediately re-inert it.

Check for benzene vapor before entering compartments that recently carried benzene. Entry without PPE is not permitted if OEL-TWAs may be exceeded. Tests for benzene vapours require appropriate detector equipment, such as detector tubes, provided on vessels likely to carry benzene cargoes.

###### Gas-Free for Entry Without Breathing Apparatus

For entry without breathing apparatus, ventilate a tank or space until hydrocarbon gas concentration is less than 1% LFL, and tests confirm 20.9% oxygen by volume and the absence of hydrogen sulphide, benzene, and other toxic gases.

Gas freeing for other purposes must be thoroughly assessed and understood before operations commence to establish and implement all necessary safety measures.

##### Gasoline Fractions (Naphtha, Unleaded Gasoline, etc.)

Inhalation of gasoline vapor can cause:

Paralysis

Headaches

Nausea

Dizziness

Coughing

Muscle spasms

Vapor concentration of gasoline over 0.15% by volume is unsafe for work. Death can occur in an atmosphere with a concentration of 2.4% or more.

Many hydrocarbon gases and others of crude oil origin have carcinogenic or other long-term adverse health effects.

Avoid inhalation, even of concentrations considered safe in the short term.

##### Mercaptans

Mercaptans are organic sulphur compounds present in some crude oils, natural gasoline, and feedstock.

The toxicity hazards and precautions for mercaptans are similar to those for H2S. They have a OEL of about 0.5 ppm.

Some mercaptans are not soluble in water.

If entering tanks that contained cargoes with mercaptans concentrations over 100 ppm by weight, consult charterers about the need for special procedures or gas detection equipment.

The permissible exposure limit (PEL) of mercaptans is 0.5 ppm.

##### Handling Static Accumulator Cargoes

This section applies to the carriage of static accumulator cargoes in non-inerted tanks. Petroleum distillates often have electrical conductivities of less than 50 picoSiemens per meter (pS/m) and are considered static accumulators.

These cargoes can carry enough charge to present an ignition hazard during and up to 30 minutes after loading.

Inerting tanks is the safest way to mitigate electrostatic risks.

If a flammable atmosphere is present (in non-inerted tanks), the following measures should be taken to prevent electrostatic hazards:

Restrict product flow to a maximum of 1 m/s at the individual tank inlets, regardless of design, during the initial stages of loading until:

The filling pipe and any other structure on the tank bottom are submerged to twice the filling pipe diameter and all splashing and surface turbulence has ceased.

Any water collected in the pipeline has been cleared.

Load at a rate of 1 m/s for 30 minutes or until two pipeline volumes (from the delivery tank to the ship's tank) have been loaded into the receiving tank, whichever is less.

Continue restricting product flow to a maximum of 1 m/s at the tank inlet for the entire operation unless the product is clean (i.e., no water).

Avoid splash filling of the tank.

Bond metal objects to the ship's metal structure to eliminate spark discharge risks between metal objects. This includes metallic components of any equipment used for dipping, ullaging, and sampling.

Remove any loose conductive objects that cannot be bonded.

Do not blow the lines using compressed air.

The limit of linear velocity of 1 m/s applies to the branch line of each individual cargo tank and should be determined at the smallest cross-sectional area, including valves or other piping restrictions, in the final section before the tank's loading inlet.

Calculate approximate volumetric flow rates corresponding to a linear velocity of 1 m/s in cargo piping, considering the smallest pipe diameters encountered by the flow from the manifold to the tank. Refer to ISGOTT 6th Ed., table on page 208.

Reasons for Restricting Flow to 1 m/s

At the start of filling a tank, water may mix with oil entering the tank, creating a potent source of static electricity.

Low product velocity minimizes turbulence and splashing, reducing static electricity generation and water spreading.

Low product velocity minimizes mist formation that may accumulate charge, even if the oil is not considered a static accumulator.

Once these measures are achieved, increase the loading rate to a maximum linear velocity of 7 m/s for bulk loading.

If no flammable atmosphere is present (inerted tanks), usual flow linear velocity limitations of 12 m/s apply, if system design permits. This velocity is a guideline, generally considered above the threshold where pipeline erosion may occur at pipe joints and bends.

###### Ullaging, Dipping, and Sampling in Non-Inerted Tanks

If a flammable atmosphere is possible within the tank, specific precautions are required for safe ullaging, sampling, and gauging when handling static accumulator products.

Static accumulator cargo surfaces may be charged and at high potential during and immediately after loading.

Bond and earth metallic dipping, ullaging, and sampling equipment to avoid electrostatic discharge.

Caution: Allow a settling time of 30 minutes after loading a tank before starting dipping, ullaging, sampling, or any operation that introduces equipment into the tank. This allows gas bubbles, water, or particulate matter to settle and any electrical potential to dissipate.

Preventive Measures

- Do not dip, ullage, or sample with metallic equipment while a static accumulator is being loaded.

- Bond metal objects to the ship's metal structure to eliminate spark discharge risks between electrically insulated metal objects. This includes metallic components of equipment used for dipping, ullaging, and sampling.

- Remove any loose conductive objects that cannot be bonded.

- Prohibit the use of conductive (metal) ullaging, dipping, gauging, or sampling equipment during cargo transfers into a tank and for 30 minutes after operations complete.

- Prohibit the use of non-conductive (non-metal) containers over one litre capacity for dipping, ullaging, and sampling during loading and for 30 minutes afterward.

Non-conductive containers under one litre capacity may be used for sampling in tanks at any time if they have no conducting components and are not rubbed before sampling.

Cleaning with a high conductivity proprietary cleaner or soapy water is recommended to reduce charge generation. Do not rub the container dry after washing to prevent charging.



### 8.1.11 Material Safety Data Sheets - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Management of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)

###### Introduction

This procedure provides guidance to ship staff on managing Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for chemicals and cargoes. MSDS should be readily accessible to all employees handling hazardous chemicals on board or who could be exposed in an emergency.

###### Responsibilities

Masters and heads of department are responsible for maintaining and updating the MSDS files for chemicals, cargoes, bunkers, or paints on board.

###### MSDS Requirements

An MSDS must be placed on board in the following situations:

- Whenever a chemical is received for the first time or if the MSDS has been revised. This applies to both dry and tanker vessels.

- Prior to loading any type of hazardous cargo:

- Tankers: Crude Oil, Oil Products, Chemicals

- Bulk Carriers: Bulk cargoes classified as Material Hazardous in Bulk (MHB) and IMDG cargoes

- Container Carriers: Carriage of containers with IMDG cargoes must include a Dangerous Cargo Manifest and refer to the IMDG code for handling emergencies.

- Prior to loading any type of bunkers (FO, MGO, MDO, etc.).

- Whenever any type of paint or paint additives is received for the first time or if the MSDS has been revised.

Subsequent deliveries of the same chemical from the same supplier may not need an MSDS unless it has been revised.

### 8.1.12 Equipment and Tests - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Testing of Cargo Pipelines and Bunker Transfer System

Latent defects in the cargo or bunker system can be identified when the system is pressurized during the discharge/transfer operation.

Pressure tests provide an indication of the system’s condition at the time of the test. They are not a substitute for regular external inspection of the pipeline system and periodic internal inspections, particularly at known failure points, such as pump discharge bends and stub pipe connections (ISGOTT 7.3.2). Testing procedures for the bunker transfer system are covered in detail in Ch. 14.2.

Test cargo pipelines of oil tankers hydrostatically to 100% of their rated working pressure (sometimes referred to as maximum allowable working pressure - MAWP) annually.

Test cargo pipelines with liquid (use sea water) to 150% of their rated working pressure at least twice within any five-year period. Mark the pipelines with the date of the test and the test pressure. Keep a record of those tests on board. Record test results of cargo lines and bunker lines in PMS Software, including proof such as photographs of the test or a completed and signed checklist.

Visually examine and carry out ultrasonic wall thickness measurements at least once every five years on cargo or bunker pipelines passing through a ballast tank/void spaces or ballast pipelines passing through any oil tank. If subject to an enhanced survey, carry out the same during the enhanced survey and file reports in the appropriate file.

At REEDEREI NORD, the MAWP of the cargo systems for all vessels in the fleet is 10 bars at the manifolds.

Depending on the vessel’s construction and the cargoes that are designed to be carried (considering the maximum density for which the system was designed), the pressure testing for the pipelines at the bottom of the pump room (if existing) will be MAWP plus the static head pressure of the transfer system.

All vessels in the fleet must set their cargo pressure relief system to actuate at 10 bars plus the static head pressure of the transfer system according to US CFR 33 § 156.170 (b), depending on the location of the sensing unit (on deck or in the pump room).

As per US CFR 33 § 156.170, the following conditions must also be met:

- Each transfer system relief valve/system must open/actuate at or below the pressure at which it is set to open/actuate.

- Each pressure gauge must show pressure within 10 percent of the actual pressure.

- Each loading arm and each cargo and bunker transfer pipe system, including each metallic hose, must not leak under static liquid pressure at least 1 1/2 times the maximum allowable working pressure; this test should be carried out on an annual basis, at a minimum.

- Each item of remote operating or indicating equipment, such as a remotely operated valve, tank level alarm, or emergency shutdown device, must perform its intended function.

If required, on occasion, to discharge at a higher pressure at the manifold, contact the technical department for further advice.

###### Inspection of Cargo, IG / Vapor Recovery Pipelines

Cargo, inert gas, and vapor recovery pipelines and associated fittings should be visually inspected every three months or as per prescribed intervals indicated in PMS Software.

External visual examination of cargo, IG, and vapor recovery pipelines should cover all components, including:

- Full pipeline length

- Flanges and their bolts

- Expansion couplings

- Local and/or remote pressure gauge and thermometer inserts or connections

- The condition and adjustment of U-bolts and any rubbing inserts

If deterioration in the condition of any of the above elements is observed, take immediate and appropriate maintenance action to restore integrity.

Record any findings in the defect reporting system in PMS Software and follow up with TSI. Upon completion of maintenance work, inform the office and close the defect after consultation with TSI. Support findings and maintenance work with photos. Make appropriate records of the inspection in PMS.

Note: After maintenance work on the cargo transfer system (pipes, fittings, etc.), carry out a hydrostatic pressure test as described above up to MAWP to ensure the system's integrity after repair.

###### Inspection and Test of Cargo and Bunker Reducers, Spool Pieces, Portable Pipework

Each tanker carries several manifold reducers and spool pieces to accommodate the manifold connection size requirements of different terminals.

Design standards for reducers and spool pieces are outlined in OCIMF/CDI’s Recommendation for Oil and Chemical Tanker Manifolds and Associated Equipment by ASME B16.5.

To protect the fixed manifold flange, a spool piece or reducer that connects to the loading arm or hose should be used.

No more than one spool piece or reducer should be fitted between the manifold flange and the flange presented for connection.

All spool pieces and reducers are fitted with a lifting lug. This lug should be placed as near to the centre of gravity as possible and at a location that does not interfere with either the operation of quick-acting couplers or with the bolting up of flanges.

Use the designated lifting lug to safely transfer a reducer from its storage place to the desired manifold. Connect guiding ropes to the reducer when transferring to avoid undesired movements and swings of the portable pipework. Use gaskets made of material suitable for the cargo to be transferred.

Place a bolt in every flange hole while connecting.

Note: Reducers and spool pieces are heavy pipework, which should be handled in a planned and safe manner when transferring to and from manifolds.

####### Storage and Inspection

Each tanker has designated storage arrangements for cargo and bunker reducers and spool pieces. Keep unused reducers and spool pieces bolted and secured in a vertical position with their flange faces well protected from environmental conditions.

Clean flange faces and apply grease for additional protection against corrosion before covering. If reducers are stored outside of a sheltered place, cover the entire storage arrangements and reducers with canvas or other suitable material that will provide protection against water, salt, etc.

Carry out regular inspections of the entire body and inner part of reducers and spool pieces in accordance with PMS Software requirements and setup intervals.

Clean reducers after use and before storage.

If pitting is observed on the reducer's body, attend to it without delay and apply a new coating as per specifications. Maintain appropriate records of inspection and maintenance as outlined in PMS Software.

####### Testing

All manifold reducers, spool pieces, and other portable pipework should be provided with pressure test certificates.

A manifold reducer, spool piece, or other item of portable pipework should have the same or greater pressure test rating as the fixed manifold piping to which it is connected.

Test manifold reducers, spool pieces, and other portable pipework hydrostatically to 100% MAWP of the transfer system to which they connect annually.

Test manifold reducers, spool pieces, and other portable pipework (use sea water) to 150% MAWP of the transfer system to which they connect at least twice within any five-year period.

Issue a test certificate for each piece of portable pipework and maintain appropriate records. Manifold reducers, spool pieces, and other portable pipework should be marked with the date and pressure of the last test.

Depending on the ship’s design, number of available reducers, their weight, size, etc., the required hydrostatic test can be achieved using one of the following options:

Option 1 – Test the reducers, spool pieces, etc., during annual and bi-annual pressure tests of the cargo/bunker transfer system by alternating reducers connected to the manifolds.

Option 2 – Test the reducers, spool pieces, etc., using a Graco pump.

Note: Blind flanges used for testing should have the same pressure rating as the reducer flange and be rated to a pressure equal to or higher than the rated pressure of the reducer.

##### Maintenance and Test of Cargo and Ballast Valves

###### Introduction

Cargo and ballast pipeline systems are equipped with automatic and manual operating valves. Both types of valves should be fully operational and in satisfactory condition.

Mark each cargo valve with its individual identity number.

###### Testing and Inspections

All automatic/hydraulic/pneumatic valves are subject to 3-month tests as per PMS, which includes:

- External inspection

- Valve timings (opening/closing)

- Maintenance

Use Forms TANK 18 / A, B, C to record this maintenance.

Note: The timing of opening/closing remote-operated cargo/ballast valves shall be adjusted as per the manufacturer’s recommendations to prevent pressure surges in the pipelines.

Additionally, manifold, manifold crossover valves, and any other critical valves shall be subject to hydrostatic pressure and leak testing at least twice in a 5-year period, with records maintained.

Note: Carry out this test together with the cargo pipeline testing to 150% MAWP.

The cargo manual valves, including non-return cargo valves should be visually inspected monthly and tested for manual opening and closing.

In addition, cargo valves must be checked for leakages by pressurizing the cargo lines with cargo pumps if the vessel is loaded. Records of this test must be kept on board and made available.

For guidance on maintaining automatic and manual cargo and ballast system valves, consult the manufacturer's instruction manual, relevant ship's drawings, and PMS.

Regular monthly inspections should be conducted on the emergency hydraulic pumps used for valve operation, as per PMS, ensuring they remain in a state of constant readiness for immediate use.

###### Cargo Sea Valves

Before entering the first loading port and the first discharging port, check for the presence of oily ingredients using the cocks and air cocks provided to sea-chests.

Verify the integrity of the sea chest by pressure testing.

Caution: Do not pressure test cargo sea valves while the vessel is on a deep-sea passage.

Testing arrangements shall be provided for cargo sea suction valves. A device to monitor the pressure build-up between the inboard and outboard valves shall be available. The indicators shall be:

- Positioned above the Pump Room bottom platform (i.e., above the gratings) to prevent exposure of personnel to toxic gases accumulated on the lower floor plates

- Capable of measuring pressure/vacuum

Test using air, but never exceed a pressure of 3.5 kg/cm².

Maintain records of the test.

Place a notice reading:

- “START PUMP BEFORE OPENING SEA SUCTION”

- “DO NOT OPEN CARGO SEA VALVE WITHOUT C/O PERMISSION”

in a conspicuous location, next to each cargo sea suction valve in the Pump Room and in the Cargo Control Room.

###### Cargo and Ballast Control Console

Cargo and ballast system controls and indicators should be accurate and fully operational during cargo transfer-related operations. The responsible officer should ensure that:

- Remote pressure indicators are connected and displaying a value appropriate to the status and operation of the system or pipeline being monitored

- Remote temperature indicators are connected and displaying a value appropriate to the status and operation of the system or pipeline being monitored

- Tank level indicators are connected and displaying an accurate value

- Draught, list, and trim indicators are displaying an accurate value

- Cargo and ballast pump speed controls are fully functional and that the pumps are being controlled from the cargo control room (not locally)

- Cargo and ballast system mimic diagrams, displays, and indicators are showing the correct status of valves, pumps, temperatures, pressures, levels, and any other monitoring functions designed to be displayed

Maintain proper records of inspection, testing, and maintenance of the above in accordance with the manufacturer instruction manual as prescribed in PMS intervals.

Conduct a risk assessment in the event of a system sensor, control, or indicator failure, considering all applicable hazard mitigating measures to continue with cargo operation. Record the failure as a defect in PMS Software and consider implementing Management of Change procedure if applicable.

Send the risk assessment to MSI and TSI for approval before continuing with cargo-related operations.

###### Maintenance

Cargo valves are subject to continuous maintenance.

If any cargo valve is suspected of malfunction, immediately repair or replace it with a new one.

The vessel should carry a minimum of one new valve seat ring of each size and type in the cargo system, and enough spare parts.

Make reports in the PMS Software system after each inspection, and attach checklists ‘TANK 18 – A, B, C’.

Valves that have been repaired or renewed should also be reported.

###### Reference, Forms

- PMS Software

- TANK 18 - A, B, C

##### Loading Computers

Ensure that approved loading and stability information manual is available on board.

- Test loading computers against class-approved test data at each Annual and Special Survey in the presence of a Class Surveyor. File the endorsed test condition with the Class Surveyor.

- Test loading computers monthly on board.

Testing Procedure:

From the approved test conditions, calculate at least one load case (other than light ship).

Note: Actual loading condition results are not suitable for checking the correct working of the computer.

Steps:

Retrieve the test load case and start a calculation run; compare the stability results with those in the documentation.

Change several items of deadweight (tank weights and cargo weight) to alter the draught or displacement by at least 10%. Review the results to ensure logical differences from the approved test condition.

Restore the initial test condition and compare the results. Confirm that the relevant input and output data match the approved test condition.

Alternatively, select one or more test conditions, enter all deadweight data as if it were a proposed loading, and verify the results against the approved test conditions.

Note: Enter test entry data per tank/compartment from the keyboard, not retrieved from the computer’s memory.

Maintain records of all stability calculations after verification of accuracy.

Caution: Do not over-rely on Loadicator. Be aware of applicable trim and heel corrections when calculating cargo intakes. In case of sensor failure, arrange for periodic manual measurements and input data into Loadicator to avoid miscalculations.

Inform the company immediately if any inaccuracies are discovered.

Note: Shore-based calculators are used by the operations department to cross-check loading/discharging plans submitted by the vessel for review before cargo operations.

##### Tanks monitoring systems

###### Cargo Measurement & Monitoring Equipment

Cargo measurement equipment should be periodically checked against reference calibrator instruments:

Pressure/vacuum gauges in cargo tanks (every 6 months)

Pressure manometers on cargo pipeline systems and manifolds (every 6 months)

Thermometers in cargo tanks and on cargo pipeline systems (every 12 months)

Radar/floating ullaging systems (every 12 months)

UTI (every 12 months)

MMC (every 12 months)

Note: Use forms TANK 25, TANK 26, TANK 27. Keep a copy of this record on board for inspection. Report inspection / maintenance in PMS Software.

Each vessel should be equipped with:

Reference thermometer and/or temperature calibrator (certified yearly)

Pressure/vacuum manometer and/or pressure calibrator (certified yearly)

Note: Keep a copy of the certificates on board for inspection.

###### Fixed monitoring system

Tank monitoring equipment often has multiple functions, such as radar or other types of remote gauging, temperature measurement, tank-pressure sensors, and level alarms.

It may be integrated with other cargo monitoring or control equipment or with loading computers or control systems.

Carry out calibration, testing, and maintenance of tank monitoring systems in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction manual at intervals prescribed in PMS.

Verify the accuracy of fixed level and temperature gauges against the independent measuring devices (UTIs/MMC) during cargo operations and record the results using form TANK 26.

Verify the accuracy of integrated pressure sensors of the tank monitoring system before every cargo operation by comparing individual sensors with a portable reference gauge, using form TANK 25.

Test the audible and visual alarms of the fixed level measuring system before every cargo-related operation.

Maintain appropriate records related to the testing, calibration, and maintenance of monitoring system sensors.

A risk assessment should take place in the event of a system sensor failure, considering all applicable hazard mitigating measures to continue with cargo operation. Record the failure as a defect in PMS Software and consider implementing Management of Change procedure if applicable.

Send the risk assessment to MSI and TSI for approval before continuing with cargo-related operations.

If a temporary exchange of a sensor with another tank is considered, check the compatibility and re-calibrate the sensor (if required).

###### Portable Tank Level Gauges and Temperatures

An adequate quantity of MMC/UTI devices exists onboard (usually 4).

In case of breakdown of UTI sets available onboard, the company shall arrange repairs or delivery of replacement units as soon as possible. Inform TSI immediately when a failure of a UTI/MMC occurs.

Verify the accuracy of fixed level and temperature gauges against the independent measuring devices (UTIs/MMC) during cargo operations and record the results using form TANK-26.

UTI/MMC devices must also be tested/calibrated by a shore-qualified technician annually, with records kept in the PMS. A Calibration Certificate shall be issued.

Maintain and inspect UTI/MMC as follows:

- Inspect and test UTI/MMC devices before every cargo-related operation and at intervals prescribed in PMS.

- Clean and inspect UTI/MMC devices after every cargo operation and store them in a safe location.

- Replace batteries at regular intervals to ensure correct measurements and readings.

###### Temperature Gauges

Install temperature gauges at the manifolds only when loading heated cargo and cargoes that require special attention to the cargo temperature.

When loading non-heated cargo, remove the temperature gauges and plug the sockets with the original plugs.

Inspect the pockets of the thermometer aperture at least monthly.

Caution: Do not install thermometers with long stems, as the velocity of cargo flow can damage them, causing leakage.

Company recommends the use of original SIKA thermometers.

Please contact your technical superintendent for specifications before placing an order.

Verify the accuracy of temperature gauges against a reference thermometer every 3 months and maintain records using form TANK 27.

###### Samplers

An adequate quantity of sampling devices exists onboard (usually 2).

In case of a breakdown of a sampling device available onboard, the company shall arrange repairs or delivery of replacement units as soon as possible. Inform TSI immediately if a sampler failure occurs.

Inspect sampling devices before every cargo-related operation and at intervals prescribed in PMS.

Maintain appropriate records of the inspection of samplers in PMS.

Any repairs of sampling devices should be undertaken only in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruction manual.

Clean and inspect sampling devices after every cargo operation and store them in a safe location.

Caution: When using samplers, ensure they are properly adjusted to minimize / eliminate the release of toxic gases.

###### Cargo, Ballast and Stripping Pump Temperature Sensing Devices

Except for pump rooms intended solely for ballast transfer or fuel oil transfer, temperature monitoring systems for pumps should be provided.

The following pumps installed in cargo pump rooms, which may be driven by shafts passing through pump room bulkheads, are included:

- Cargo pumps, including slop pumps

- Ballast pumps

- Stripping pumps

- Tank cleaning pumps

Note: Small pumps of 1 m³/h capacity or less and bilge pumps are not required to be fitted with temperature sensing devices.

Temperature sensing points should be provided as follows:

Unused sea chest and overboard discharge valves are closed, sealed, or blanked.

Firefighting and SOPEP equipment are deployed and ready for use before arrival at the berth.

Deck scuppers are plugged as soon as the vessel berths.

Vapor recovery system and manifolds are in good order and drained.

Cargo tanks are depressurized prior to arrival if required

Note: Tank pressure should be reduced to not less than 100 mmwg.

Report all deficiencies detected during the preparations prior to the start of cargo operations to the Master and Office.

Take appropriate corrective action as per the company’s defect reporting and rectification procedures.

On arrival at the berth, complete the ISGOTT safety checklist jointly with the terminal representative.

Note: Both parties should sign the SSSCL.

The Chief Officer shall make a thorough check of the cargo system pipeline and valve line-up.

The checks should include verification of their correct position for:

Valve settings

Vents

Overboard discharges

Record the check, along with the names of the persons involved, in form TANK 45 “Line up checklist.”

Note: The cargo system line-up as per forms Tank 45 shall be cross-checked and signed by one more Officer

Make a thorough check of the IG and tank venting systems.

Visually inspect the surface of the ballast for oil traces using the sighting port and record results in the port logbook.

Caution: if oil sheen (cargo or hydraulic) is observed at the surface of the ballast take all required actions as per the EMER 06 – “Structural Failure/Tank Leakage”( if applicable) and the necessary steps to avoid pollution during de-ballasting.

###### Tank Survey Before Loading

The Chief Officer shall:

Accompany the terminal loading master and attending surveyors for the arrival condition survey. Check all tanks.

Record dips and ullages and corresponding quantities of any oil, water, or sediment found.

Prepare an OBQ certificate for signature by all parties attesting to the agreed survey findings.

Protect the interests of the company and the charterer during tank surveys.

The OOW shall:

- Supervise manifolds connection

- Verify readiness of firefighting and SOPEP equipment

###### Pre-Transfer Conference (PTC)

The Chief Officer shall hold a meeting with the Terminal Representatives to:

Discuss the cargo loading plan and agree

Discuss International and local safety regulations

Agree on Pollution prevention measures and actions

Agree on Emergency procedures

Carry out the checks as per the SSSCL

Complete form Tank 10 – Cargo Operation Agreement

Once the loading plan has been agreed upon, it should be signed by the Responsible Officer and Terminal Representative.

Procedure for Starting to Load

The chief officer and OOW shall do this procedure

When notice to start loading is received from the terminal:

The C/O shall check the line-up.

The OOW shall independently make a final check of the line-up.

If all is in good order, open the first tank valve and the cargo manifold valve.

Personnel equipped with walkie-talkies shall man the deck, as per Form TANK 14, as follows:

The chief officer shall be stationed in the cargo control room (CCR).

The OOW shall monitor manifolds during commencement of operations

The pumpman shall be in the pump room.

A rating shall stand by on deck at the first tank.

A rating shall monitor the offshore side manifolds

A rating shall inspect cargo lines against leakage

Control vapor pressure in cargo tanks as follows:

Monitor the pressure in the cargo tanks via the secondary venting system (pressure sensors)

Ensure that the pressure in the cargo tanks is maintained within safe limits

If a vapor return line is connected ensure correct working pressures are maintained

Note: coordinate with Terminal to ensure that the loading rate does not exceed the VRL limitations (i.e. high and low pressure settings).

The chief officer should request cargo delivery at the agreed initial loading rate.

Note: Radar-gauging beams tend to reflect off internal tank structures and may give false readings during the early stages of loading a tank. Observe the manufacturer's specific operating and maintenance instructions.

Once cargo is confirmed flowing into the selected tank:

Check the main deck for any signs of leakage.

Check the manifold connection(s) for any signs of leakage.

Check the pump room for any signs of leakage.

Check overside, around the vessel, for any signs of leakage.

If all checks are satisfactory, the chief officer may proceed with the loading plan as follows:

Open the first-stage tanks.

Ask the terminal to slowly increase the rate to the maximum agreed

Caution: Do not exceed the loading rate limits specified by the shipbuilder and agreed upon during the PTC conference.

Note: These are usually based on the vessel's tank-venting capacity and the liquid flow across the valves.

When the requested loading rate has been attained, check again:

All cargo tanks for cargo inflow.

Deck for leakages or inconsistencies.

Pump room for leakages or inconsistencies.

Over the side for traces of spill.

Verify that tanks vapour pressure remain within the safe parameters by operating the Mast Riser, or ensuring that the P/Vs (where a Mast Riser is not provided) are operating as required

    - Completed

##### During Loading

Maintain an hourly record of the actual tank ullages and average loading rate using form TANK 42 during the loading operation. Update the cargo computer with current data to confirm safe:

GoM

Stresses

Stability

Draught

Trim

Document in the CCR logbook the regular monitoring of mooring conditions to prevent the vessel from breaking off the berth due to:

Cargo operational conditions

Environmental issues

Passing by traffic

Any requests for increasing or decreasing cargo transfer rates should be recorded together with confirmation when these rates are achieved. At least two officers (including junior officers) or petty officers (e.g., the pumpman) should carry out independent physical cross-checks and line settings:

Prior to the commencement of the cargo operation (loading/discharging)

Prior to starting loading/discharging a different grade

Prior to the commencement of C.O.W (when applicable)

Prior to stripping

Upon completion of the cargo operation (loading/discharging)

The cargo plan and records should contain sufficient information to reconstruct the progress of the cargo operation and determine which tanks, pumps, and lines were involved at any point during a cargo transfer.

Procedure During Loading

The chief officer and OOW shall do this procedure:

Maintain adequate deck watch throughout loading and ensure:

- Manifolds are permanently attended

- Permanent gangway watch

- Periodic deck and mooring inspection

- Periodic Pumproom inspection, where applicable

Control listing or excessive trimming, using only hydraulic valves.

Caution: Do not control filling of tanks using manual valves.

Ensure that the required minimum numbers of tanks are opened to accommodate the agreed loading rate.

At an appropriate stage, control the loading rate of the working tanks:

- To stagger the completion of each tank at safe intervals.

- To achieve a convenient sequence for topping up

Check all completed or empty tanks frequently to confirm that the cargo level is not changing

During the loading operation, keep all proportionally controlled hydraulic butterfly valves in the correct position (e.g. neutral, closed, opened)

Note: Follow instruction manuals strictly to ensure correct valve operation during loading.

Compare fixed gauging system with portable gauging equipment to ensure correctness.

Record the results in the form TANK 26.

Caution: If the UTI/MMC measurement differs from the fixed gauging system, conduct ullaging only by using UTI/MMC.

Calculate cargo quantity loaded each hour and compare it with shore to determine the differences. (Use form TANK 42)

Note: Hourly increase in ship/shore difference can indicate a loss of cargo. This will require investigation on board and on shore.

Inspect deck and Pumproom areas regularly until the loading operation is completed.

    - Completed

##### Control of COTs vapor pressure during loading

Use the mast-riser for normal venting during loading.

For vessels designed to vent from P/V valves during loading, or if required by the terminal to use this method instead of the Mast Riser, take the following precautions:

Prepare a risk assessment for the procedure and discuss the issue with your marine superintendent on each occasion.

Study the vessel’s loading manual to determine the venting capacity of each P/V valve.

- Comply with the maximum loading rate per tank, based on venting capacity

- Compare pressure sensor readings for each tank against manual pressure gauge readings to ensure correctness

- If pressure increases beyond safe limits, reduce the loading rate.

Caution! Do not open the P/V valves manually. Allow them to release at their opening set pressure, and monitor carefully.

Note: This will achieve the desired result of the vapor being released to the desired height above the deck.

When a vessel is loading multiple parcels using the Mast Riser as the method to control the vapor pressure:

- Load one parcel at a time, and

- Isolate other tanks from the common vapor line.

Caution! Do not load two different parcels at the same time using a mast-riser, if there is any risk of contamination.

Seek office approval in case there is any deviation from these procedures.

##### Topping-up Tanks

###### Introduction

Filling tanks to 98% capacity is very normal on tanker vessels. However, personnel need to be aware that a successful loading operation depends on the alertness of the staff in monitoring ullages.

Continue to monitor tanks, after topped up to 98%, by portable gauges and compare with the fixed gauging system. Once confirmed that the tank valve is shut and the level is steady monitoring can continue using the fixed gauging system.

When more than one grade of cargo or more than one parcel is loaded, the planning should consider maintaining reduced trim to avoid tank overflow.

Caution! Do not change the setting of the independent High High-Level Alarm (HHLA) which is set to 98%, even if the alarm activates.

Vessels fitted with independent High-Level alarms set to 95% should not change this setting either.

Use loading programs/software where additional alarms can be set if necessary. Use these alarms settings to provide additional indication/alarm for the cargo level.

The loading plan should allow for expected cargo volume expansion due to changes of cargo temperature during the voyage. Ensure that the 98% COT filling limit is never exceeded during the voyage.

Procedure for Topping-up

The chief officer and OOW shall do this procedure:

The chief officer shall carefully plan, organize and strictly control this operation.

Use sufficient personnel to monitor all working tanks and maintain checks and records on any tanks that have been shut down either temporarily or on completion.

Temporarily suspend other vessel activities or use additional personnel.

The OOW shall give the topping-up operation full attention.

The chief officer shall ensure that the following steps are taken in good time before topping-up operations begin:

Inform the terminal and reduce flow rate to agreed topping-up rate.

Check the level of the valve hydraulic service tank.

Cross-check the remote ullaging equipment readings of these tanks against manual ullages and log them in the cargo/deck logbook, along with any discrepancies.

Note: Perform these actions well before topping-up starts.

During the topping-up operation, use both of the cargo valve hydraulic remote control system pumps.

Note: This will ensure the smooth and speedy operation of the cargo valves.

Monitor the hydraulic pressure, especially during valve opening/closing sequences.

Follow the correct procedure when changing over tanks that are being topped-up.

Note: As one set of cargo tanks approaches the desired minimum loading ullage, open the next set of tank valves to 100%.

Establish a positive flow to ensure that pressure surging will not occur if any other cargo tank valves are throttled or fully closed.

Note: Indicate on the cargo loading plan the number of cargo tank valves to be always left open when topping-up, to prevent over-pressure of the ship or shore piping and loading hoses.

Use the portable ullaging devices (UTI) during the final topping-up.

Notify the terminal in advance of shipboard operations which might influence terminal pumping operations.

The chief officer must allow for the time needed by the terminal to reduce rate or stop.

On completion of loading, if the terminal wants to drain the contents of the loading hoses or arms into the vessel, use the following procedure:

Leave manifold valves and the finishing tank valve open until this has been accomplished.

Shut the tank and manifold valves.

Open the manifold drain valves before disconnecting the loading arms, under. the supervision of a responsible officer.

Blank off manifold connections immediately after disconnection.

    - Completed

##### De-Ballasting During Loading

The chief officer and OOW shall:

- Plan to complete de-ballasting to complete well before starting to top off cargo tanks

- Ensure that the ballast water surface is inspected prior commencement of de-ballasting

- Record the result in the CCR Logbook

- Post a lookout to inspect the quality of ballast water discharged in the initial stages

- Aim to strip dry all ballast tanks using eductors, while the vessel is trimmed well by the stern

- Notify the terminal before starting to deballast.

- Maintain hourly records

##### Ship’s Specific Tanker Damage Stability

Ensure that the vessel:

Is operated as per loading conditions specifically approved for the applicable damage stability requirements.

Has been assessed for compliance using approved damage stability KG/GM limit curves.

Has an onboard damage stability program acceptable to the administration based on requirements of:

Intact Stability approval required by Load Line Convention ILLC for all vessels after 21st July 1968.

Damage Stability approval required for:

MARPOL Annex 1 - Oil tankers delivered after 31st Dec 1979

Chemical Codes (BCH or IBC Code) - Chemical tankers with keel lay after 12th April 1972

To assist with this, consider the below-mentioned factors/criteria:

Documentation relating to trim.

Intact stability onboard.

Damage stability onboard.

###### Typical Stability Information Onboard

Stability Information Booklet (SIB) – Standard Loading Conditions

The stability information booklet includes loading cases that have been approved with reference to intact stability, damage stability (where applicable), and strength requirements. Damage stability information may also be included in a separate booklet. However, the SIB is the primary document and covers both intact and damage stability (where applicable).

Stability Information Booklet (SIB) – Allowable Limit Curves

The SIB will often include KGmax or GMmin limit curves that allow the master to evaluate stability for a range of conditions. However, these may be for intact stability only. Reference to MARPOL, BCH/IBC Code, or EGC/GC/IGC Code will show that damage stability has been included.

Stability Loading Program (i.e., Loading Instrument)

Software undertakes longitudinal strength and stability calculations for any loading condition. The software may or may not be able to verify damage stability compliance. The presence of damage stability capability can be confirmed if the program or user manual makes reference to MARPOL, BCH/IBC Code, or EGC/GC/IGC Code or if the program has a damage stability option.

###### Stability Information Requirements

To avoid problems with third-party inspections, the master shall ensure the following:

The ship's master should provide an SIB approved or provisionally approved (for new ships or ships that have recently changed flags) by the classification society on behalf of the flag. This can be demonstrated by the presence of an approval statement on the first few pages of the SIB.

The SIB should be in the working language of the ship or at least in English. The master should be able to demonstrate his understanding of the SIB with the language so written.

Where required by MARPOL and chemical codes, the vessel should have evidence of damage stability approval for all the loading conditions included in the SIB. A useful indication that the SIB has been assessed for damage stability is that the SIB is stamped as complying with MARPOL Annex I, BCH/IBC Code, or EGC/GC/IGC Code.

Loading conditions that are not significantly different from existing approved loading conditions may be considered acceptable. Refer to the historic record of loading conditions and compare them to approved conditions. To be acceptable, the filling of each cargo and ballast tank must lie within 1% of the weight in the approved condition, and GMf must lie within 2 cm of the approved condition GMf.

If the master is unable to present a loading condition as stated above, he must be able to demonstrate compliance by verification and presenting documentation as stated in paragraph 1, 2, or 3 below.

###### Current Arrival / Departure Sailing Condition

Where the ship is not loaded as per an approved condition in the SIB, it is acceptable if written authority from flag/class has been obtained that this alternative loading condition is satisfactory. This will normally be in the form of printed loading conditions, in addition to those included in the SIB. The additional loading conditions must be accompanied by an approval statement.

AND

Assessing the alternate loading condition by referring to critical damage KGf or GMf data in the approved SIB would be an acceptable alternative. The limiting KGf or GMf limits should be clearly presented with sufficient guidance to ensure they are being correctly applied.

OR

The presence of damage stability capability can be confirmed if the program or user manual refers to MARPOL, BCH/IBC Code, or EGC/GC/IGC Code or if the program has a damage stability option.

To avoid detention of the vessel, the master shall ensure that the vessel is in compliance with points 1, 2, or 3, as well as the vessel's current arrival/departure sailing condition as demonstrated as required by points 1, 2, or 3.

####### Compliance Verification Flowchart

##### Loading over the top

Closed loading, although recommended, may not be practical due to trade practices (e.g., vegetable oil trade). In such cases, consider loading over the top as a normal practice. The vessel must send a risk assessment to the office for approval before loading over the top.

Caution: This procedure is strictly prohibited for crude oils, all petroleum products, and all volatile cargoes.

##### Loading on Top

Loading on top allows hydrocarbon material recovered during tank washing to be commingled with the next cargo.

This loading procedure is followed when the cargo is loaded while the tank still contains slops, consisting of oil, water-oil emulsion, and some water remaining after tank washing and pumping out unpolluted water.

If the next cargo is compatible with the slops generated from the last cargo, it is possible, with the charterer's approval, to load the next cargo on top of the slops. Conduct load-on-top (LOT) procedures in compliance with MARPOL regarding retention of oil on board.

Charterers sometimes require the slops to be spread evenly around the vessel's tanks before loading. The slops (after decanting the free water) may contain up to 30% water in suspension. This may result in serious saltwater contamination of the next cargo.

The following recommendations apply to the LOT procedure:

- Proceed carefully with the LOT slop tank decanting.

- If charterers insist that slops are to be spread in all the vessel's tanks, the master should refuse to do so, as this procedure may contaminate the whole cargo.

- If the charterer's intentions prevail and slops are distributed among the cargo tanks before loading, then upon arrival at the discharge port, the master should suggest in writing that wet bottoms and slops are discharged first to a single shore tank in order to minimize the danger of spreading wet bottoms throughout the shore tank system.

- Proper care of the cargo takes priority.

- If the cargo consists of two or more parcels, load the largest parcel on top of any retained slops, unless the smaller parcel is more compatible.

##### Ullaging of Loaded Tanks

The chief officer shall:

  - Reduce the cargo tanks vapor pressure to safe limits during the tank survey.

  - The chief officer and pumpman shall accompany the cargo surveyor(s) for the survey.

  - Make the vessel upright before ullaging begins.

  - Ensure that cargo measurements are correct, including but not limited to the following:

- Water cuts

Note: It is normal to find that no water is detected during the cargo survey. Water may be in suspension and might settle out with time. As a precaution, dip all tanks again on passage to the discharge port. Record any significant free water and report to the operations department immediately.

A mean of three ullages taken as accurately as conditions permit, to the nearest millimetre if possible.

A mean of temperatures at the top, middle, and bottom levels of the cargo in every tank.

Oil/water interface of the slop tank(s).

Observed drafts: forward, aft, and amidships.

Check of pump-room valves and seals.

Representative sampling using a closed sampling method. (Tanks must remain closed.)

##### Vessel Cargo Sampling

All vessels must use devices provided for closed sampling when cargo is carried in an inerted tank condition. Adhere to all safety precautions when sampling.

A responsible officer should accompany the surveyor during the sampling process. The terminal or independent surveyor must seal the vessel's samples and document the sealing.

The chief officer shall ensure that:

manifold samples are drawn at the start of loading.

Note: If discoloration of cargo is observed, immediately inform the terminal, surveyor, and master. If necessary, suspend loading until the issue is rectified.

first-foot samples are drawn

Note: Retain sealed samples on board for a minimum of 13 months. Take particular care to prevent shoreline contamination when loading clean products.

If possible, take a shoreline sample before the start of loading, in the presence of the terminal operator or surveyor.

Seal such samples and retain them on board. They can be utilized in the event of any problems with dirty shorelines. Retain samples in a store within the cargo deck area that have access external to the accommodation.

The terminal or independent surveyor must seal the vessel's samples and document the sealing. When drawing samples, personnel must use personal protective clothing as necessary according to the product handled.

Note: Refer also to guidance provided in Chapter 8.1.1. – General Tanker Practices.

##### Cargo Calculations

On completion of the tank survey, the chief officer shall calculate the cargo quantity independently of the surveyor(s) and then compare the official ship's figure with theirs. Since all will be using the same data and (usually) the same tables, there should be no difference between the ship's and inspector's figures.

Ships should use one of the vessel’s UTI/MMC tapes to measure and calculate the ship’s figures.

Note: The same UTI/MMC tape shall be used at the discharge port.

If the surveyor insists on using their tapes for calculation, the vessel shall independently use the vessel’s UTI and calculate with the measurements observed.

Caution: If the surveyor’s UTI/MMC is used for measuring the cargo, the Ullage Report issued by the surveyor must be marked “for ullages only.” A similar remark is allowed for the surveyor to insert on the vessel’s ullage report.

Investigate any significant difference to identify the reason for such a discrepancy and resolve it.

Where the early departure procedure has been agreed upon and the shore API and temperatures are not available, before the vessel leaves the berth, the chief officer and the surveyor must both endorse a record of:

Agreed tank ullages

Corresponding volumes

Observed temperatures

Water dips

On receipt of the required cargo data from the terminal, they shall complete their calculations, exchange results, and agree on final figures by telex or other agreed means.

###### Wedge Formula

Dimensions for Wedge calculation

The Wedge formula is:

Volume (V) =  L x B x p2 
				      2 x T

Where V    = volume 
			L    = LBP
			T    = Trim (Between Perpendiculars)
			p    = Corrected dip
			B    = Breadth of Tank

p    = (p1 cosec Ø + (y - d tan Ø)) tan Ø.

Where p1 = Measured dip
		y    = Distance from measuring point to aft bulkhead of tank
		d    = Tank ref height
		Ø    = Trim angle in degrees Tan-1 (Trim/LBP)

This formula assumes that the liquid is free flowing and that the vessel is upright at the time of measurement.

####### Worked Example

VLCC, LBP 320m, Breadth of Tank 20m, y = 4m, 
	ref height d = 30.5m, measured dip  p1 = 40 cm. Trim = 8m.

Calculate the volume of liquid remaining in tank.

Trim angle Ø    =  1.432 degrees

p = [0.4 x cosec 1.432+(4-30.5 tan 1.432)]tan 1.432 = 0.48m

V = ( 320 x 20 x 0.482)/16  =  92.2m3

###### Vessel Cargo Calculations

Calculate the cargo quantity using agreed figures obtained at the tank survey as prescribed below. Some inspectors will use calculation methods that differ from those used by the chief officer. The chief officer’s calculations must conform to API guidelines, using the attached example pro-forma capacity report.

Total Observed Volume (TOV)

Apply trim and list corrections to the observed tank ullage, double-checking that they are added or subtracted correctly.

Enter calibration tables with the corrected ullage.

Record TOV in barrels (bbls) or cubic meters (m³).

Free Water (FW)

Apply any list or trim corrections to the observed sounding for water dips.

Enter the calibration tables and extract the free water volume (bbls/m³).

Gross Observed Volume (GOV)

Subtract the FW volume from the TOV in each tank.

Temperature

Record the observed average temperature for each tank.

API Gravity/Specific Gravity (SG)

Note the API gravity/SG as supplied by the terminal, ensuring that this is at standard temperature and in air.

If the SG is given "in vacuum," correct it to "in air."

Volume Correction Factor (VCF)

Enter the appropriate petroleum measurement table with the observed temperature and API gravity to find the volume correction factor for each tank.

Round the API figure to the nearest 0.5-degree API.

Note: Do not interpolate. For example, for a given API of 30.7, use API 30.5 in table 6A.

Gross Standard Volume (GSV)

Multiply the GOV by the VCF to obtain the GSV.

Weight Correction Factor

Multiply the gross standard volume of oil by the correction factor in Table 11 (long tons) or Table 13 (metric tons).

Table 11 can be read to the nearest decimal, so interpolation is necessary.

Ship's Pipeline Contents

The vessel should have details of the diameter and length of all the cargo pipelines, from which the total volume can be calculated.

###### Vessel Experience Factors

The Vessel Experience Factor (VEF) is the historical difference in the ship and shore figures for a ship over a period. A VEF is used to assess the validity of quantities delivered to the ship that are derived from shore measurements.

Vessel capacity tables are often calculated from the vessel’s building plans rather than based on accurate physical tank calibration measurements. This means that there are usually differences between the quantity of a cargo measured in a calibrated shore tank or by a custody transfer meter, and the quantity determined by vessel tank measurements.

For any given vessel, a simple ratio can be found between the quantity of liquid measured on board the vessel and the corresponding measurement by a load or discharge facility. A historical compilation of this ratio, typically over 10 voyages, is known as the vessel experience factor (VEF).

In simple situations, the application of a VEF is the principal way a Chief Officer is able to assess if the bill of lading quantity is reliable. In more complicated situations, such as when shore-based measurements are not available or are known to be inadequate for custody transfer, and subject to agreement of interested parties, bill of lading or out-turn quantities may be determined based on vessel received or delivered quantities adjusted by the VEF.

####### Calculating Vessel Experience Factor

Loading Vessel Ratio (LVR)

Discharge Vessel Ratio (DVR)

If a TCV ratio (vessel/shore) appears to be in gross error, the ratio may be deleted with the written agreement of both parties.

Non-qualifying Voyages

The following voyages are not admissible as qualifying voyages:

First voyage after dry dock.

All voyages involving STS lightering operations.

Voyages where bills of lading are based on shipboard measurement.

Voyages prior to any modification that has affected the ship’s carrying capacity.

Voyages where the vessel has loaded several parcels or voyages where the vessel is only part-loaded to less than 75% capacity.

##### Early Departure Procedure (EDP)

###### Introduction

EDP may be required for the following reasons:

By the charterer, to save time.

By the terminal to minimize occupancy of the berth.

In some ports, to meet minimum under-keel clearance (UKC) requirements.

Masters should check with the charterers and port authorities in advance if EDP is to be used.

###### Guidance for Early Departure Procedure

Request and Advice:

Prior to arrival, the master requests EDP, or the terminal advises that EDP is required.

Document Submission:

Before the completion of loading, the agent will submit the cargo shipping documents to the master for his acceptance.

These documents are then returned unsigned to the agent, who must provide the master with a full set of document copies for his reference.

Agreement on Limits:

Agree to the specified limits in advance.

Departure Process:

The vessel leaves the berth immediately after final ullages, temperatures, water dips, and tank volumes have been agreed upon with the surveyor(s).

Calculation and Authorization:

Calculate the ship's official figures on receipt of the API, along with the bill of lading cargo figures from the terminal.

Provided the ship and bill of lading figures agree within specified limits, the master then authorizes the agent by fax or e-mail to sign the bills of lading and other associated shipping documents.

Protest for Differences:

The master should protest any difference between ship/bill of lading figures, no matter how small.

Caution: Do not sign blank bills of lading in anticipation of the subsequent entry of accepted figures.

##### Cargo Documents

Vessels on time charter or in Pools should normally use commercial documents in the format provided by the charterer or pool. When there is direct exposure of the owner’s interest, use the owner’s format, such as LOPs.

Prepare the following documents after the completion of the tank survey:

Letters of Protest (as applicable) for:

Delay for free pratique

Delays in berthing/un-berthing

Delays in port

Ullaging while rolling/open sea conditions

Slow loading

Short loading

Ship/shore difference

B/L clauses

Note: In case of doubt, the master may issue additional letters of protest as required. See guidance in the section below.

Arrival and completion tank survey ullage reports

OBQ certificate

Empty tank certificate (if applicable)

Tank condition report prior to loading

Statement of free water in cargo

Sea chest seal certificate

Vessel’s experience factor

Slop Certificate (if any)

Bill(s) of lading copy

Cargo manifest

Statement of facts or time log

Certificate of quality

Certificate of quantity

Cargo sample receipt

MARPOL (IBC) certificate (if applicable)

The terminal representative and the surveyor(s) must sign the letters of protest to indicate receipt, and the other documents to indicate agreement and acceptance of survey findings and the time log. In the event of any refusal to sign, the agent should endorse the document concerned to the effect that the terminal or surveyor declined to sign.

###### Guidance on Issuing Letters of Protest

Refer to Chapter 8.5.2 for detailed guidance.

##### Blending/Comingling of Cargo (Production Processes during the Voyage)

###### Regulations

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) prohibits the blending of bulk liquid cargoes by using ship’s cargo pumps and pipelines to internally circulate two or more different cargoes, as well as any production processes on board ships during the sea voyage. Each port state and port authority defines the respective port locations and limits and the circumstances under which blending may be undertaken in port.

The IMO prohibition of ‘production processes’ does not include the use of inhibitors. The prohibition against blending cargoes applies to the mixing of additives or dyes only if they are also carried and declared as cargo. However, the prohibition against production processes applies if these substances are used to react with the cargo to produce a new end product that varies in specification from the original cargo.

The prohibition of blending cargoes, as set out in MSC-MEPC.2/Circ.8, does not apply when cargo is re-circulated within its cargo tank or through an external heat exchanger during the voyage to maintain cargo homogeneity or temperature control, including when two or more different products have previously been loaded into the same cargo tank within port limits.

###### Introduction

Shipboard commingling or blending of cargo is not done without risk.

The commingling or blending may affect the specification of the cargo already loaded, and the carrier may be held liable under any bill of lading already issued for such cargo.

The same liability may arise under the bill of lading to be issued for the second parcel of the cargo to be loaded. While a remark can be inserted in the bill of lading for this parcel drawing attention to the commingling/blending, should the cargo be loaded in apparent good order and condition, there will be no basis for clausing, which casts doubt on its apparent order and condition.

There may also be complications with regard to dates and places of shipment stated in the bills of lading. If dates and places are different, a single bill of lading should not be issued.

Onboard blending is a recognized means by which the cargo may be prepared to specification (if nothing goes wrong) in the vessel’s tanks, normally by volumetrically blending individual components.

Onboard blending offers certain conveniences to suppliers, particularly to oil traders that may have limited (or no) terminal facilities. Some of the negative aspects of onboard blending are:

A greater number of variables and unknowns

Errors are more difficult to fix

Physical mixing is limited

###### Letters of Indemnity

The charterer or shipper has no right to require commingling or blending unless this has already been agreed upon in the charter-party.

The law specifically requires the carrier to segregate parcels loaded at different times, even if they are of the same grade. Shipboard commingling or blending is outside the normal scope of the carrier’s obligations under the Hague/Hague-Visby Rules and will most likely affect the P&I cover for any liability which may arise as a consequence.

A carrier who, for commercial reasons, wishes to comply with a request from a charterer to commingle or blend onboard should require a suitable Letter of Indemnity (LOI) offering the best possible security in terms of any liability that may be incurred and also in respect of costs and expenses incurred, including loss of time. Additional costs or liabilities due to blending should be for the charterer’s account.

It is extremely important that the charterer’s orders regarding the blending of cargo are in writing, including the name of the charterer’s authorized signatory. The orders must be clear so it can be shown later exactly what the charterer required.

Owners should always seek confirmation in writing from charterers/shippers that the receivers/consignees, who are buying the cargo, know about and agree to the proposed blending.

###### Cargo Additives Including Dyes

Charterers may require adding additives to some cargoes. This should be stated in the charter party or in the voyage orders. Additives are used for various purposes, such as:

H2S scavengers

Cetane improvers

Pour point depressants

Lubricity improvers

Compatibility studies

Conductivity improvers

Corrosion inhibitors

Oxidation stabilizers

Metal deactivators

Dyes

The Master must inform the office when such a request or instruction is received. The office may approve the operation after the required documentation/indemnity is provided by the charterers. If approved, the Master must first receive the Safety Data Sheets (SDS) of the additives to ensure that all crew are aware of the hazards.

Note: If the SDS is not provided, the Master must request it.

The vessel’s crew shall not be involved in the process of adding additives.

Note: They may assist with the operation, provided they wear the required PPE.

Although the crew should not be involved in the doping operation, the Master should receive and review the supplier’s doping plan and related risk assessment. The Master must forward the doping plan and risk assessment to the office for additional review before the operation starts.

The doping plan and risk assessment provided should contain information regarding:

Any flammability or toxicity hazards associated with the additive

The method of doping to be used and any operational restrictions

Arrangements for supervision by the ship’s crew

PPE and handling equipment requirements

Contingency measures, including the method of clean-up of any spillages

Storage requirements for any additive to be carried on board

Appropriate anti-static precautions if tanks are not inerted

Upon receiving the plan, the Master should carry out an onboard risk assessment, check that all relevant items have been addressed, and ensure the risks are reduced to as low as reasonably practicable. The vessel’s responsible officer must supervise the operation from a safety and environmental protection perspective only. He/she should be familiar with the doping plan, associated risk assessment, and hazards involved in the operation.

After carrying a cargo treated with additives, the Master must exercise care when preparing the cargo tanks for the next cargo. A thorough cleaning of cargo tanks and the cargo pipeline system may be required even if the next cargo is of the same grade as the previous one.

##### Sloshing Effect

Within a range of tank filling levels, liquid can move within a tank due to:

The natural pitching and rolling movement of the ship at sea

The liquid free-surface effect

Structural damage can be caused by considerable liquid movement, creating high impact pressure on the tank surface. This effect is called sloshing.

Beware of sloshing due to partial filling, which can produce progressive waves known as hydraulic jumps, resulting in high dynamic loads.

When the tank motion is large, the front of the hydraulic jump becomes steeper, developing a breaking wave.

If the hydraulic jump hits the bulkhead before breaking, a large impact can occur. The uniform velocity of the hydraulic jump also results in a large drag force on the lower part of the pump tower and its supporting system.

###### Precautions with Respect to Sloshing

Note: Masters should avoid partial filling and asymmetrical loading. When unavoidable due to nominated cargo intake, vessels may proceed with partial filling and asymmetrical loading if constructed as per CLASS Common Structural Rules (CSR). This information is available in the vessel stability booklet and statements from the vessel's classification.

Vessels subject to sloshing restrictions should take the following precautions to avoid damage:

Cargo Tank Levels:

Maintain the level of the tanks within the required limits:

Lower than a level corresponding to 10% of the height of the tank or as stipulated in the stability booklet for the maximum filling level

Higher than a level corresponding to normally 70% of the height of the tank

Post the filling and loading limits and restrictions to ensure that cargo and/or ballast tanks remain free of sloshing restrictions.

For vessels with a ship-specific Certificate of Fitness, the applicable limits, along with analysis, will be stated in the certificate and posted accordingly.

Ship’s Movement:

Try to limit the ship’s movement to prevent sloshing in the tanks.

Note: The amplitude of sloshing depends on the condition of the sea (wave pattern), the trim, and the speed of the ship. Often, a minor alteration of course may change the ship motion considerably, particularly at high speed, significantly affecting sloshing.

###### Emergency Departure with Sloshing Restrictions on Tank Levels

The master should decide, in coordination with the terminal and company, to make an emergency departure during loading or discharging operations. The below recommendations are provided only for exceptional circumstances (severe weather, tsunami, or force majeure events). Consider them if staying at or entering an oil terminal would imply a risk more severe than navigating with tanks outside the approved filling range.

This guidance intends to lessen possible damages that could be caused but shall never eliminate such risk. The guidance refers to an emergency departure from a port when the level in any one or more of the cargo tanks is between 70% to 10% of tank height.

Note: This range is not approved for filling tanks due to sloshing restrictions. It aims to mitigate the risk of damage caused by sloshing during the time necessary to return the filling level in each tank to within the approved range, which has to be carried out as soon as possible.

Refer to the guidelines for drawing up an emergency plan and preparing a risk assessment when such a need arises, always in consultation with the company.

Carry out internal cargo transfer in the shortest possible time. Get your transfer plan approved by the company. Start cargo transfer as soon as loading/unloading operations with the terminal have been interrupted and an emergency departure is expected to avoid non-approved filling levels. After vessel departure, record in the bridge logbook, for the duration of the vessel being at sea with tanks out of the approved filling range:

Parameters relevant to the ship’s situation

To the containment system

Environmental conditions

Position

Course

Speed

Loading condition (weight distribution, draft, list, trim)

Sea condition

###### Vessel Heading

Liquid motion in partially filled tanks is most influenced by the vessel’s heading.

Avoid beam seas, whatever the filling level.

Sailing from head seas to bow quartering seas gives significantly better navigating conditions.

Improve the situation by sailing as close as possible to head seas.

Best conditions are provided by sailing from stern quartering seas to aft seas.

INFLUENCE OF HEADING ON RISK OF SLOSHING DAMAGE

###### Filling Levels

Return filling levels to within the approved range as soon as possible to reduce risks. A filling range of 20%H – 30%H generates the most severe liquid motions (progressive waves, hydraulic jumps) in all sea states and at all headings. Minimize the period spent at sea with fillings in this range, as far as possible (particularly during cargo handling operations). Loads due to sloshing might increase significantly in the immediate vicinity of the approved filling limitation. This is more particular for the lower filling range. Transfer cargo to establish the filling range of each tank with precision inside the approved filling limits, whenever possible.

RISK OF SLOSHING BY FILLING RANGE

###### Speed Guidance

While the effect of change in heading or filling level is significant, anticipating the influence of ship’s speed is difficult. Adjust the speed parameter as follows:

Maintain reduced speed when adjusting the ship course as per the vessel heading guidance.

Once the course is selected, evaluate the cargo agitation based on:

Noises coming from cargo tanks

Free surface elevation

Increase the ship speed (e.g., by 3 knots step) while the course is maintained.

Re-evaluate the cargo agitation.

If the modification of ship speed results in less cargo agitation, adopt the new speed.

Perform a new evaluation at a higher speed.

If the change of ship speed results in more cargo agitation, adopt the reduced speed.



### 8.1.3 Laden Passage - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### The Laden Passage

###### Inerting / Pressurising

Maintain positive inert gas (IG) pressure in cargo tanks upon completion of loading, gauging, or sampling, whether the tanks are loaded or empty. If the pressure falls below the set low level, start the inert gas plant to re-pressurize the system. Tanks are protected from over-pressurization by:

Cargo tank high-velocity vent valves, which open automatically if pressure reaches the set pressure/vacuum, depending on the manufacturer

Pressure/vacuum breaker on the IG main line

Crude oils or other cargoes with a high vapor pressure can generate a continually increasing system pressure, especially immediately after loading.

Vessels carrying crude oils should implement VOC Management Plan procedures/practices to minimize the release of VOC to atmosphere.

The OOW must vigilantly monitor the IG pressures and comply with C/O orders regarding the requirement to maintain safe vapor pressure in the cargo tanks (e.g. by ensuring that P/Vs are operating at required parameters or by topping up IG when required).

###### Cargo Condition Records

The chief officer shall:

Check cargo tank ullages daily, as conditions permit. Record the ullages in form TANK 41 and sign the report

Report any significant discrepancies or differences in ullage readings immediately to the master and investigate on board.

Monitor tank atmosphere daily and record findings using form TANK 50.

For heated cargoes, monitor cargo temperatures daily, and record them in form TANK 49.

Pay special attention to ullages and temperatures of cargo tanks loaded with non-heated cargo (or heated cargo at lower temperatures) which are adjacent to tanks with higher temperature cargo, or bunkers to prevent overflowing due to thermal expansion.

##### Cargo Migration from a Cargo Tank to a Ballast Tank

The Chief Officer is responsible for:

Using a fixed gas detection system for ballast tanks and void spaces to monitor their atmosphere

Ensuring the alarms are set to required limits

Testing and calibrating the system monthly

Note: Where a fixed gas detection system is unavailable, or is out of order, maintain daily records of tanks or void spaces atmosphere using gas detectors.

Sound ballast tanks daily and record readings using forms TANK 54 and TANK 55.

Ensure all crew are familiar with the type of cargo on board and associated dangers.

Inform the office immediately in case of cargo migration, providing the following information:

The position of the vessel

Identity of the cargo/ballast tank(s)

Advice if these tanks can be isolated

The amount of cargo that has migrated and if it is ongoing

Caution: When measuring levels in the ballast tank, strictly comply with electrostatic precautions.

###### Scenarios to implement in case of cargo migration:

1) Initial Action by C/O

Report to master

Check MSDS and Certificate of Quality to assess volatility and/or toxicity of cargo

Check hydrocarbon (HC) content in the space’s atmosphere at different levels (consider the space's design/structure)

Restrict personnel exposure to gases and provide adequate instructions and protective measures/equipment

Estimate the rate of the leak if possible

Conduct a risk assessment to identify which management methods described below are most appropriate to control the situation

Note: The decision to implement any of the below methods should be taken in conjunction with the office.

2) Minimize Cargo Migration

Consider internal cargo transfer if there is available space in other cargo tanks

Run stability calculations to ensure compliance

Conduct internal transfer of cargo to other tanks

Consider partially filling the ballast tank to overcome the static head of the cargo

Caution: Ensure the cargo does not react with water before deciding to fill with ballast.

Consider periodically stripping the double hull tank to a cargo tank to maintain a low cargo level

Note: This can be done by connecting the stripping pump suction line to the ballast line.

3) Control Double Hull Tank’s Atmosphere

  - a) Continuous Ventilation

Note: Applicable to migration of cargo with low RVP (non-volatile) and minor leaks of other types of cargo

      - Use air ducts to reach the lowest levels of the space for efficiency

      - Ground ventilation equipment to avoid the buildup of static electricity

      - Use as many portable blowers as possible for better volumetric transfer

      - Install flame screens on the space vents (remove the vent heads)

      - Keep personnel away from HC or toxic gases

      - Wear adequate PPE and breathing equipment (EEBD, SCABA) when testing the tank’s atmosphere

  - b) Inerting Double Hull Space

Note: Applicable, but not limited, to migration of cargo with high RVP (volatile) and large cargo leaks

      - Remove one vent head from the space and install the dedicated P/V valve

      - Install flame arrestors on other vents

Note: To minimize hydrocarbon vapor transfer from cargo tanks, temporarily close all cargo tanks' IG supply valves where fitted. Purge the main IG line with inert gas before connecting the hoses. Do not connect the hoses until needed.

      - Check electrical continuity of the dedicated inerting hoses before installation as required; record the results.

      - Inert at the lowest possible speed until the oxygen concentration is less than 8% vol.

Note: Inert gas is heavier than air and will settle at the bottom.

      - Once completed, seal off the free tank vent.

      - Maintain the atmosphere at positive pressure using the P/V valve.

      - Periodically check the atmosphere and top up IG if required.

Caution: Strictly comply with all electrostatic precautions throughout the inerting process and for 30 minutes afterward. During inerting, ventilate the exhaust vapor from the tank through an opening at least two meters above the deck. Use portable standpipes where necessary, fitted with flame arresters.

4) Gas Freeing Double Hull Space

Note: Conduct a risk assessment and select the most suitable gas-freeing method. The final decision shall be made in conjunction with the office.

  - a) Filling the Tank with Ballast Water

      - Strip the double hull space of any remaining cargo to a cargo tank using the stripping pump.

      - Fill the tank with ballast water; this is the most efficient method, especially for handling non-volatile cargo.

      - Do not overflow the tank.

      - Keep personnel away from gas exposure.

      - Transfer the oil film from the ballast water surface to a slop tank using portable pumps.

      - Use oil absorbent material to clean the ballast surface from the oil film.

      - Empty the tank to a reception facility.

      - Ventilate with as much equipment as possible; use air ducts.

      - Check the atmosphere at different levels.

      - Once HC <1% LEL and Oxygen = 20.9% vol, clean the tank of oil residues.

      - Flush thoroughly the ballast lines if they were used for transferring oil.

Note: Comply with Enclosed Space Entry procedure.

      - Transfer contaminated wash water to a reception facility.

  - b) Gas Freeing

      - Install as many blowers as possible and introduce large volumes of air.

      - Install flame arrestors on the remaining vents.

Caution: Always observe static electricity precautions.

      - Use air ducts to reach the bottom of the space as closely as possible.

      - Keep personnel away from gas exposure.

      - If the design permits, use IG blowers and introduce fresh air through the ballast line/valves to increase the efficiency of double bottom ventilation.

      - Check the atmosphere at different levels.

      - Issue an Enclosed Space Entry Permit.

Caution: The responsible person shall check the atmosphere of the space before allowing man entry. Carefully test the atmosphere in the double bottom area; use respiratory equipment when doing this.

      - Clean the space of any oil residues using water/chemicals.

      - Dispose of wash water to reception facilities.

      - Thoroughly flush ballast lines if they were used for oil transfer and dispose of the wash water to reception facilities.

Use the above guidance to manage cargo migration to a ballast tank/void space. Based on the vessel’s equipment and design, the vessel’s management team can propose alternative methods.

##### Pre-Arrival Checks and Tests During Laden Passage

Conduct operational tests of critical equipment and systems three days before arrival and make routine inspections before the vessel's arrival at the discharge port. This will allow sufficient time to rectify any defects found, given a sufficiently long sea passage. Tests and inspections shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

Inert gas system (IGS)

Cargo hydraulics system

Crude oil washing system (COW) (Crude Oil Tankers)

Portable instruments

Water dips

All fixed gas detection inspection equipment

Pipelines and valves for cargo, ballast system on deck & pump-room

Cargo and ballast pumps and associated gauges/sensors/alarms/trips

Support arrangement for piping and valves

Deck and pump-room lighting

Tank overfill alarms

Note: Refer to C/L Tank 01.

###### Inert Gas System (IGS)

Check that the IG deck main non-return and manual block valves are free. Test each fan by running it, delivering to the atmosphere via the mast riser. During these trials, check:

The operation of the pneumatic suction and discharge valves in the IG flat

The operation of the fixed O2 analyzer

Remote read-out in the cargo control room (CCR)

Check that all IGS control equipment is operational, including:

The high-temperature alarm

High, low, and very low-pressure alarms

The O2 alarms

Calibrate the portable oxygen meters and the fixed O2 meter in the IG flat.

###### Cargo Hydraulic System

During the laden passage, keep the hydraulic system running at all times and keep cargo and ballast (remote control) valves in the position recommended by the manufacturer’s instructions to avoid creep opening.

Vessel-specific hydraulic system operational instructions should be posted in the CCR.

Keep all other valves closed, including bottom crossover valves.

Keep the deck valves open to prevent thermal expansion within the deck cargo pipelines.

Test the control system and alarms as follows:

High and low pressure

Low oil level

Automatic start/stop function (where applicable)

Maintain the portable emergency hand pumps in good operational condition. All relevant ship’s staff must familiarize themselves with the correct operation of this equipment as per the manufacturer’s operation manual.

Give special attention to the need to isolate a specific valve from the rest of the valve system to prevent any accidental opening of other valves.

###### Crude Oil Washing System - COW (Crude Oil Tankers)

Pressure test the crude oil washing system to the maximum working pressure specified in the vessel's crude oil washing operations and equipment manual.

Verify the accuracy of the crude oil washing line pressure gauges.

Tighten any leaking flanges and replace flange gaskets if necessary.

Blank the tank-cleaning heater to isolate it from the crude oil washing system.

Blank all connections for the portable tank-washing machines.

Check any crude oil washing machine-drive units found defective when last used and overhaul them as necessary.

###### Portable and Fixed Instruments / Detectors

Check the portable UTI/MMC (ullage, temperature, interface) tapes for:

Correct operation

Damage

Digital temperature readings compared against thermometers

Electrical continuity by measuring the resistance between the tape and the connector (every 3M)

Check all portable oxygen analyzers, tank scopes, multi-gas detection units, etc.

Note: If necessary, calibrate these units and record the findings in the port/cargo log.

If the vessel has a fixed system for detecting flammable gases in ballast tanks, check operation daily during the laden passage. Record this in the cargo logbook.

Maintain a documented procedure to sample for flammable atmosphere with portable equipment in case of failure of the fixed gas detection unit.

Note: The procedure shall include ballast tanks, cofferdams, or other such spaces within the hazardous zones of the vessel where explosive vapors can accumulate.

Note: The frequency of testing will depend on the voyage length, vessel condition, type of cargo, etc. Test at least daily and record in the cargo logbook.

Advise the office of any defects in the fixed gas detection system.

###### Deck and Pumproom Pipelines, Valves and Supports

Inspect all visible pipelines on deck and in the pumproom.

Check for leakages after the pressure test.

Inspect the expansion couplings and ensure the holding bolts are properly tightened.

Inspect supports for pipelines, ensuring they are free of cracks or other abnormal conditions.

Check the pipeline U-bolts for tightness.

Note: There should be a small gap between the U-bolt and pipeline to allow free movement of the pipe due to temperature changes.

###### Water Dips

Monitor water dips of cargo tanks regularly throughout the voyage.

Report any unusual findings to the chartering department.

Record the readings in the cargo logbook.



### 8.1.4 Discharge Operations and COW - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Preparation for Arrival at Discharge Port

###### The Discharge Plan

####### Introduction

- Prior to the start of the cargo operation (loading/discharging)

- Prior to starting loading/discharging a different grade

- Prior to the start of C.O.W (when applicable)

- Prior to stripping

- Upon completion of the cargo operation (loading/discharging)

Make a thorough check of the IG and tank venting systems.

Prevent contamination by thoroughly draining pumps and pipelines before changing to a different grade or by following the segregation guidelines on tank cleaning.

On crude oil tankers plan to discharge high pour point or high viscosity crude parcels first, if possible, to avoid the risk of blocking lines with solidified cargo.

Before arrival, conduct a meeting to explain and discuss the discharge and COW (Crude Oil Washing) plan with all officers and ratings involved in these operations. Enter the records in the vessel's logbook.

###### Terminal Notification for Crude Oil Washing (COW) (Crude Oil Tankers)

If the charterers or cargo receivers do not request or accept crude oil washing beyond the mandatory MARPOL requirements, the owner may be held liable for any delays resulting from additional crude oil washing operations.

Master shall:

Note a protest holding the receivers liable for any consequent shortage in out-turn of the cargo if they restrict crude oil washing.

Consult with the charterer to agree on the proposed crude oil washing program in good time before arrival at the discharge port.

Request permission from the terminal authorities to perform crude oil washing.

###### Pre-transfer Conference (PTC) Procedure:

The chief officer shall do this procedure:

Conduct a pre-transfer conference with terminal representatives, including at least the following items:

- Completion of the ISGOTT and terminal safety checklists, signed by the chief officer and terminal representative

- Completion of form TANK 10 - Cargo Operation Agreement

- Ship and terminal safety regulations and emergency procedures

- Ship/shore communications and notification requirements

- Any shore restrictions, including the location of the shore tank—distance from the ship and height above the vessel's manifold

- Pollution prevention and response measures

- Slop discharge (if any) and tank stripping procedures

- Procedures for draining shore hoses or hard arms on completion of discharge

- Final discharging sequence (if more than one grade)

Revise the plan as required due to shore restrictions or limitations and circulate revisions to all concerned personnel. Master shall approve any changes to the discharge plan before commencement of operation..

###### Tank Survey before Discharge

The chief officer shall do this procedure.

- Provide the attending cargo surveyor(s) with details of the discharge plan and the load port cargo figures.

- Reduce the tank inert gas pressure to about 100 mmwg (if applicable) to facilitate closed gauging, after agreement with the terminal.

- Accompany the surveyor during the tank inspection to ensure that correct measuring procedures are followed, in the interests of the vessel and owners.

- Calculate the arrival cargo figures independently of the surveyor(s) and compare the results.

- Investigate and reconcile any significant differences and agree on a final official figures.

Note:	Surveyor or terminal representative will usually take discharge port cargo samples.

###### Main Cargo Pump(s) Start Guidance

The chief officer and OOW shall do this procedure

Shut the discharge valve and open the suction valve fully before starting.

Prime the pump using the stripping pump or vac-strip equipment, if fitted.

Set the pump speed governor to minimum in manual control.

Instruct the engine room to start the pump turbine and bring the pump up to slow speed.

Note: This is not required for vessels with submersible Framo pumps.

Caution: Do not adjust the pump speed until the engine room indicates that control has been passed to the cargo control room (CCR).

###### Main Cargo Pump(s) Operation Guidance

The chief officer and OOW shall do this procedure

Gradually increase the pump speed.

As the discharge pressure slowly rises, open the discharge valve to its maximum.

Notify the engine room before making large alterations in pump speeds.

Check tank levels to ensure the pump never runs dry or loses suction.

Note: Cavitation or air can damage the pump.

When pumps are used in parallel, adjust pump speeds as necessary to equalize discharge pressures.

Caution: If the speed of a pump decreases and its shut-off pressure drops below the discharge pressure of the other pump(s), it will cease to discharge, and the pump casing will rapidly overheat.

Note: Change pump speeds slowly.

To prevent surge pressures on cargo and COW lines, reduce cargo pump speed to a minimum before changing the valve line-up or pressure testing the COW line during discharge operations.

Starting the Discharge Procedure

The chief officer shall do this procedure.

Make a final check of the starting line-up and confirm that:

All overboard discharges are blanked.

The cargo tank ullaging system is operational.

All IGS operational checks are satisfactorily completed, with the system functioning correctly and IG delivered with an O₂ content not exceeding 5%.

Ensure all cargo pumps are primed correctly.

Confirm with the OOW that the line-up sequence and valve setup are as per form Tank 45.

Note: This includes the line-up of cargo and ballast tank valves and the setting of inert gas and P/V valves.

Notify the terminal when ready to start the discharge and await confirmation of their readiness to receive cargo.

- Throughout the operation, monitor the tanks vapour pressure to avoid:

Creating vacuum in the cargo tanks by discharging at a higher rate than IG is supplied.

Over-pressurizing the ballast tank by ballasting at a rate greater than the ballast tank’s venting system capacity.

Note: Both issues can result from incorrect settings or defective operation of tank venting valves and pressure relief devices, leading to severe structural damage.

- Establish the following procedure to ensure cargo tank inert gas delivery valves are always correctly set:

Use an IG valve mimic diagram / board to display the current open/shut status of all tank IG valves.

Place the board in the cargo control room (CCR), clearly visible to the officer of the watch.

Note: Maintain the board continuously to always reflect the actual status IG valves.

When the terminal confirms readiness to receive cargo, ensure that duty personnel is positioned as follows (refer to form TANK 14):

OOW at the cargo manifold

Pumpman in pumproom or on deck (for vessels with FRAMO system)

One duty rating by the first tank in the discharging sequence

One duty rating monitoring offshore manifolds and deck cargo lines

Notify the terminal that the discharge of cargo is about to begin, and:

Open the valves to the first tank.

With the pump suction fully open and the discharge valve shut, start the first pump.

Test the CCR Cargo System “Emergency Stop” with the system running.

Test each COP trip (individual stops).

Note: This test must be carried out while the pump is running at low RPM for each pump intended to be used, by activating the pump’s “stop” knob on the CCR panel (see also manufacturer’s instructions). For vessels with a FRAMO pumping system, the test should be carried out at low system pressure with one pump running against a closed discharge valve, at least from one location, e.g., CCR or deck manifold.

Caution: These are two different tests; the first involves activating the entire system’s “emergency stop” pushbutton, and the latter involves stopping each cargo pump from its individual trip knob.

After confirming satisfactory operation of the emergency trips, restart the cargo pump(s) and commence discharge.

Open the cargo manifold valve(s) fully and the pump discharge valve to about 10-15%.

Obtain confirmation from the terminal that they are receiving cargo and from the

Obtain confirmation from deck watch that the working-tank ullage is increasing.

Gradually increase pump speed in while monitoring the back pressure.

Caution: During initial stage of discharging, slacken all designated cargo tanks to below 95% (safety ullage) prior to connecting other common tanks and increasing to the maximum agreed discharge rate.

Obtain confirmation from duty personnel that there are not signs of leakage at:

The manifold hose/arm connections

The tank deck

The pumproom

Overside, right around the vessel

Confirm that the IG pressure and that the oxygen content remains within safe limits.

Continue with increasing pump revolutions while opening the pump discharge valve.

Monitor the discharge and suction pressures and maintain close communication with the terminal.

Caution: On ships fitted with deep well pumps there is a possibility of cargo transfer between tanks due to difference of discharge pressures between pumps in common line. Verify cargo levels and adjust pumps revolution to prevent cargo backflow.

Maintain close liaison with the engine room and inform them of any increasing demand on plant and machinery.

When the first cargo pump has reached the appropriate / planned revolutions and the discharge from the starting tank is confirmed stable, open the other first stage tanks and start additional pumps.

Inform the terminal and engine room when the discharge operation is stabilized and the maximum discharge rate is achieved.

Note: Be cautious when operating two pumps on a common discharge line. Equalize pump revolutions and discharge pressures of both pumps to avoid uneven loading and overheating.

Maintain adequate back pressure on the pumps by throttling the pump discharge valve.

Caution!: Do not use cargo manifold valves or deck line valves to control discharge pressures or rates.

Calculate the cargo quantity discharged each hour and compare this quantity with the shore to determine the difference in quantity each hour (use form TANK 43).

Note: Hourly increases in ship/shore differences can indicate cargo loss, requiring investigation on board and ashore.

De-bottom water from tanks before use for crude oil washing.

Discharge slops first, if carried, and thoroughly crude oil wash. The tank can be refilled with dry crude oil if used as the source of the washing medium.

Inspect and drain the IGS lines at regular intervals.

Monitor the temperature of cargo, ballast, and stripping pumps bearing cases and bulkhead shaft glands, maintaining detailed records on an hourly basis.

  - Note: Use cargo pump temperature monitoring as a proactive measure to identify any indication of pump performance issues.

Update the cargo computer with current data to confirm safe GoM, stresses/stability, draft, and trim.

- Maintain hourly records of the actual tank cargo volumes by saving stability conditions from the loadicator, and hourly and average discharging rates using form TANK 43 while the discharging operation is in progress.

Maintain hourly operational records of the pumping operation, including manifold pressures and temperatures, using form TANK 07.

- Record any requests for increasing or decreasing cargo transfer rates, along with confirmation when these rates are achieved.

- Document the monitoring of mooring conditions in the CCR logbook, with respect to changes due to cargo operational conditions, environmental issues, passing traffic, etc., to prevent the vessel from breaking off the berth.

Perform at least daily during cargo operation comparison between fixed gauging system and portable gauging instruments UTI / MMC readings. Maintain comparison records in form TANK 26.

Note: If the UTI/MMC measurement differs from the primary gauging system, conduct ullaging using the UTI/MMC only.

Completed

###### Tank Draining and Stripping Operations

The chief officer shall follow below guidance.

Ensure that the vessel has a good trim before beginning stripping operations. A stern-trim angle of about 1.5° from the horizontal will produce good drainage. Single point mooring (SPM) terminals may impose limits on maximum trim.

Ensure the stripping system is lined up in good time before reaching stripping levels. When stripping with a positive displacement reciprocating pump, always keep the pump discharge valve fully open, adjusting the suction valve and pump speed as necessary to maintain good suction.

The chief officer should always refer to the operating instructions for the vessel's system.

During the final stages of discharge, take soundings of all empty tanks again to check for cargo ingress through leaking or improperly closed tank valves or the accumulation of clinkage draining from tank internals.

On crude oil tankers, it is usually necessary to stop discharging ashore and carry out internal stripping to the slop tank, using the eductor(s) on slop tank recirculation. Further crude oil washing may also be desirable if time allows.

Inform the terminal in advance when the cargo manifold valves are to be closed for internal stripping or washing.

The small-diameter line between the stripping pump and outboard of the cargo manifold gate valves (the 'MARPOL' line) must be used for draining lines, discharging into the shoreline(s) designated by the Terminal.

Open vent cocks on the cargo crossovers to break the vacuum in the system. Ensure the complete draining and stripping of all cargo lines. Ensure that vent cocks used for draining are not under pressure, as some cargo lines may remain under pressure when stripping ashore.

Note: To avoid air entering the system, use goosenecks interconnected with cargo tanks.

Upon completing the discharge, no cargo should remain on board except the contents in the MARPOL line.

Completion of Discharge Procedure

The chief officer shall do this procedure.

- Inform the terminal and engine room the estimated time of completing the discharge

- At end of discharging, drain the terminal's hoses or hard arms and then shut down the entire cargo system

- Accompany the attending surveyor(s) on the final tank inspection after the end of discharge

- Record the results of sounding of all tanks, including any sediment or un-pumpable residues found

- Independently calculate the quantity of cargo remaining on board (ROB) with the surveyor(s)

- Do not disconnect the hoses/hard arms until the tank survey has been completed and the attending surveyor has confirmed that disconnection may occur

- Blank the manifold connections immediately after disconnection

Completed

###### Emergency Cargo Discharge Arrangements

Provisions for emergency discharge from cargo tanks in case of cargo pump failure are available for each vessel.

Submersible cargo pumps (FRAMO):

- Use designated emergency / portable FRAMO pump as per manufacturer’s instructions. Maintain the FRAMO emergency /portable pump in good order and readily available. For additional details refer to Chapter 8.2.3

Conventional cargo pumps:

- Use interconnection to another pump to discharge a specific cargo tank and follow manufacturer’s instructions.

Note: All officers should be familiar with the vessel's emergency discharge arrangements and may be involved in the emergency discharge operation as instructed by the chief officer.

###### Cargo Documents

The following documents are required after completion of the tank survey:

Letters of protest (list is not exhaustive)

- Late acceptance of NOR

- Delays to vessel

- Late issue of free pratique

- Insufficient number or size of shore connections

- Shore restrictions – rate and pressure

- Shore stoppages

- Use of different ASTM tables for calculation

- Ship/shore difference in out-turn quantity

- Failure to provide discharge certificate / cargo receipt

Note: The master shall issue his professional judgment in issuing additional letters of protest, to protect charterer’s and owners interests.

Before and after discharge tank survey ullage reports

Slop certificate (if any)

ROB certificate or tank dry certificate

Statement of facts or time log

Pumping log

Cargo receipt

The terminal representative and the surveyor(s) shall sign the letters of protest to indicate receipt and the other documents to indicate agreement and acceptance of survey findings and the time log.

If there is any refusal to sign, issue a letter of protest and request the agent to endorse the document to indicate the terminal or surveyor declined to sign.

##### Crude Oil Washing (Crude Oil Tankers)

###### Introduction

The main objectives of crude oil washing (COW) are:

Reduce pollution of the marine environment by oil

Remove oil fractions and sediment from cargo tanks, minimizing or eliminating the need for water washing

Improve drainage and stripping of tanks by removing accumulated sediment and sludge

Enhance cargo discharge outturn

Reduce tank de-sludging operations and duration in preparation for dry-dock/repair periods

Minimize tank internal corrosion by reducing saltwater washing

Decrease wear and tear on cargo pumps due to sediments and solids in the system

Crude oil washing installations, associated equipment, and arrangements, as well as operations, must comply with MARPOL Annex I requirements.

They shall be class approved and have up-to-date operation and equipment manuals detailing system operational procedures.

MARPOL requires that during discharge, 25% of the tanks on a crude oil tanker should be washed on a rotational basis so that all tanks are washed at least once every four months.

The +25% should include any tank that might require repairs during the voyage.

Note: Every cargo tank that might be used for heavy weather ballasting (where available) shall be crude oil washed at every discharge.

Vessels should carry out COW according to charterers or terminal instructions and comply with MARPOL regulations.

However, to minimize ROB (Remaining On Board), they may carry out a full bottom wash in remaining cargo tanks.

Note: Do not exceed the laytime permitted under the charter party.

###### Qualifications of Officer-in-Charge of COW

The Officer in overall charge of crude oil washing shall:

Have at least one year's experience on tankers if their duties have included the discharge of cargo and crude oil washing

Have completed a training program in crude oil washing as per IMO Resolution A.446 (XI) if their duties have not included COW operations

Have participated at least twice in tank cleaning programs, one of which shall be on the specific ship for which they are responsible for cargo discharge or on a ship similar in all relevant respects

Be fully knowledgeable of the operations and equipment manual (IMO Crude Oil Washing Systems 5.2) and the P&A Manual (as applicable)

###### Supervision of Crude Oil Washing Operations

The Chief Officer (Person In Charge, P.I.C.) shall prepare a detailed COW plan before arriving at the discharge port.

COW operation shall be performed according to the plan, referring to the latest I.M.O publication "Crude Oil Washing Systems," ISGOTT, and the ship-specific COW manual.

The Master, Chief Officer, Chief Engineer, and all officers engaged in COW shall be fully familiar with the crude oil washing system.

Where the Chief Officer has less experienced in COW operations, the qualified Master shall assist in supervising operations and be knowledgeable about the Operations and Equipment Manual.

###### Requirements for COW

The Chief Officer shall prepare an integrated COW and discharge plan that does not extend the overall discharge time and meets the charterer's requirements. The plan must comply with procedures in:

- The Class-approved crude oil washing manual

- IMO crude oil washing systems guidelines (latest edition)

- MARPOL 73/78 (latest edition)

Send the COW plan to operations departments prior execution of operation.

If the operations departments have concerns, they will advise the vessel to change or amend the COW and tank cleaning plans accordingly.

Obtain approval of the vessel's crude oil washing plan from the Terminal at least 24 hours before arrival.

Complete the ship’s specific COW checklist as per the ship's COW system manual.

Caution: If a tank cleaning heater is provided outside the Engine Room (E/R), it should be blanked off during COW operation to prevent oil ingress.

###### Suitability of Crude Oil for COW

As a general guideline for crude oil suitability for COW, use the following criteria:

For aromatic crude oils, whose kinematic viscosity controls temperature, the oil's kinematic viscosity should not exceed 60 centistokes at the oil wash medium temperature.

For paraffinic crude oils, whose pour point temperature controls, the cargo temperature used for COW should exceed its cloud point temperature by at least 10°C if excessive sludging is present and should be used once in a “closed cycle” washing program.

Note: Refer to the ship-specific COW manual.

During the discharge of crude oils that exhibit criteria causing pumpability problems or sludge accumulation, COW of each scheduled tank should be carried out concurrently with discharging that particular tank to minimize the effect on crude oil residues for cooling.

Cooling will increase kinematic and dynamic viscosity and will affect COW efficiency.

###### Restrictions for COW

Stop crude oil washing operations in the following situations:

If the oxygen content in the tank cannot be maintained at 8% or less

If the IGS fails

If vapor pressure in cargo tanks has fallen under 100 mmwg

If safety of the operation cannot be maintained

If instructed by the terminal

Caution: Do not use crude oils with a high pour point or high viscosity for crude oil washing. Refer to vessel’s crude oil washing operation manual and its annexes regarding crude oils suitability for COW.

When crude oil washing is performed with heated crude cargo, avoid solidification of oil in pipelines and tank cleaning machines.

Upon discharge completion, strip to terminal reception tank any oil left in cargo lines and pumps.

If discharging a parcel of low pour point crude, in addition to heated cargo, seek permission from the terminal/charterer to retain some onboard for final flush of all cargo lines ashore.

###### Precautions Against Oil Leakage

Before arrival at the discharge port, the crude oil washing system shall be pressure tested up to Maximum Allowed Working Pressure (MAWP) as per the COW Manual.

All related pipework and joints shall be examined during pressure test for leaks.

Rectify any leaks immediately and re-pressure test the system again to ensure its integrity.

During COW operation, the system must be continuously under supervision.

Note: Immediately stop crude oil washing if system leak or fault is observed.

Upon completion of COW, drain the system of any oil.

###### IG Operation During COW

Before crude oil washing a tank, check the oxygen content at two levels:

- one meter below the deck

- at the middle level of the ullage space.

The oxygen content should always be below 8% by volume.

The oxygen content of the IG delivered during the washing process should always be less than 5% by volume and continuously recorded.

Do not resume COW until safe conditions are restored.

Test the oxygen content of each cargo tank to be crude oil washed with portable gas detection equipment not more than 30 minutes before starting COW in that tank and record the results.

###### Advanced notice

Master shall inform discharge terminal and seek permission for COW requirements before arrival

COW plan shall be discussed during the Pre-cargo transfer safety meeting with the terminal representative.

COW shall commence only after the terminal’s permission is obtained.

###### Use of Dry Crude Oil for COW

Mixtures of crude oil and water can produce an electrically charged mist during washing.

Dry crude oil has lesser electrostatic potential

Before washing begins, any tank to be used as a source of crude oil for washing should be partly discharged/de-bottomed by at least one meter to remove any water that has settled during the voyage.

If the nominated tank to be used as a source of oil for washing previously contained slop water, it should first be completely discharged ashore and refilled with dry crude oil.

Note: Refer to the vessel’s COW manual.

###### Recordkeeping

Use the form TANK 35 “COW Checklist” to record checks carried out prior, during, and after completion of COW operations.

Before arrival at the discharge port, test the COW pipelines to Maximum Allowable Working Pressure (MAWP) and record the results in the “COW Checklist.”

Always operate the crude oil washing system following the Operations and Equipment Manual.

While washing is carried out, keep the COW pipelines under constant observation to detect potential leaks.

The Chief Officer shall record the COW operation in form TANK 12 “Crude Oil Washing Program Record”. Records shall include:

Tanks washed

Period of cleaning

Number of tank cleaning machines in use

Quality and pressure of the IG in the tanks

Tank cleaning pressure

Vessel’s trim

###### Crude Oil Washing (COW) – Preparations Before Dry Dock

COW operations shall be carefully planned well in advance of Special Surveys (Dry Docking) to ensure that all tanks, including Slop Tanks, are thoroughly crude oil washed and sediments are removed to the maximum extent possible before the final Tank Cleaning operation.

If the cargo is suitable for COW, the vessel should obtain permission to crude oil wash all cargo tanks during at least the last three discharging operations before dry docking.

Note: Seek office assistance if necessary.

Top and bottom wash shall be carried out as per COW Manual procedures, with special attention to Slop Tanks.

During each of the last three COW operations before dry docking, alternate the nominated Slop Tank used for the washing medium and for collecting the stripping.

Use the following sequence for Slop Tanks COW:

Note: For this procedure, identify:

Slop 1: The tank nominated for COW medium and stripping collector of all COTs

Slop 2: The tank used to COW Slop 1

De-bottom or fill Slop 1 with dry crude oil.

Discharge Slop 2 as quickly as possible and crude oil wash it.

Refill Slop 2 with dry crude oil; this will be used to COW Slop 1 at the end.

COW and strip all COTs using the Slop 1 tank.

COW Slop 1 using crude oil from Slop 2 as the washing medium.

Discharge the result of Slop 1 COW directly to shore (do not collect stripping in Slop 2).

During the next COW, interchange Slop 1 with Slop 2.

Following this procedure should ensure minimum sediment in all tanks before Tank Cleaning.

Note: Discuss the final COW operation with the office before tank cleaning to request the Charterer’s permission to extend the time needed for a thorough operation.

During Tank Cleaning, ensure that:

Adequate pressure is built in the tank cleaning line (above the minimum pressure stated in the COW manual, usually 8 bars)

Heat up the washing water if necessary for better results.

###### Inspection and Maintenance of COW Equipment

Maintain and inspect all elements of the crude oil system at prescribed intervals according to the PMS.

Maintain sufficient spares per the spare parts list and the PMS.

### 8.1.5 Inert Gas Management - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Inert Gas System / Inert Gas Generator

###### Introduction

The inert gas system/inert gas generator (IGS/IGG) ensures safe and efficient cargo handling and tank washing procedures, minimizing the risk of cargo-related accidents.

- The IGS/IGG must provide an atmosphere within the cargo tanks that:

Will not support combustion

Will not contaminate the cargo

Is available in volume and pressure to suit all operating conditions

- Maintain the IGS/IGG in correct operation during all stages of cargo handling and tank washing operations.

- If fitted with vapor control systems, refer to the vapor emission control system drawings and instruction manuals onboard.

- If provided with connections between cargo and ballast or inert gas system, ensure that connecting spool piece is removed and pipelines are blanked.

- All personnel in charge of the vapor control system should be fully familiar and trained in:

Principle of operation

Components

Hazards

Relevant national and international regulations governing its use

- Conduct drills and demonstrations covering both normal and emergency IG procedures.

- Operate the IGS as per the maker’s manual approved by the vessel’s classification society.

- Post a placard with brief instructions about Start/Stop procedures on system control panel/s.

- Post a placard with procedures for operation, calibration, and testing of the oxygen analyser near the equipment.

- Refer to the manufacturer’s instruction manual regarding the operation, calibration, and testing of all inert gas system indicators and alarms.

###### IGS/IGG During Loading Operations

Shut the IGS and deck isolating valves during loading operations.

Confirm that safety barriers, such as the deck seal and non-return flap valves, are operational.

Isolate respective IG branches to prevent vapor contamination of different grades, particularly those with different vapor pressures.

###### Use of IGS/IGG During the Loaded Passage

A positive IG pressure of at least 100 mmWG should always be maintained in the ullage space of the cargo tanks during the loaded passage to prevent air from entering the space.

If the vapor pressure in the tanks falls to the minimum pressure alarm level, immediately start the IG plant and restore the pressure in the tanks.

Loss of pressure is usually a result of low sea or air temperatures. It is crucial that tanks remain gas tight.

Certain oil products, e.g., jet fuel and diesel oil, can absorb oxygen during the refining and storage process. This oxygen can later be released into an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, e.g., the ullage space of an inerted cargo tank.

Monitor the cargo tanks to maintain the oxygen level below 8%.

Purge or take necessary precautionary measures to maintain the oxygen level below 8% by volume.

###### Use of IGS/IGG During Discharging Operations

The chief officer and OOW shall do this procedure:

- Maintain a positive IG pressure in the cargo tanks throughout all cargo discharge operations, cargo transfers, tank cleaning, COW and slop decanting

- Adjust the IGS operation to match changes in the discharge rate

- Keep a close check on the graph recording of IGS pressure

- Keep hourly records of the IG operation

- STOP cargo operation in case of IG Failure – notice to be posted in CCR

Note:	This provides a useful visual representation of the pressure trend
and shows whether IG delivery is keeping up with the cargo discharge rate

###### Use of the IGS/IGG During Tank Cleaning and Gas Freeing

Refer to Chapter 8.1.7

##### Control of Oxygen Content in the Cargo Tanks

The chief officer and the second engineer shall:

- Calibrate the oxygen analyser unit monthly and before each use (but not more than 24 hours before operation).

- Test the IGS/IGG recorder before operation.

- Keep a record of analyser calibration.

- Ensure that IG delivered by the system has an oxygen content of less than 5% Vol.

- If the oxygen content of any tank rises above 8% Vol, stop all cargo operations until satisfactory conditions are restored.

- Monitor the oxygen content of the IGS/IGG delivery continuously and record it every one hour.

- In case of oxygen analyser failure, stop all cargo operations until the unit is repaired/replaced.

Note: Follow IGS failure procedure

- Check oxygen content of individual tanks immediately before starting crude oil washing.

- Use the IGS oxygen and pressure dual recorder whenever the plant is operated.

- Endorse the record with the date, time, and type of operation (TANK-21).

- Retain and file these records for routine inspection and IGS survey.

##### Procedure for IGS/IGG failure

The chief officer shall:

- Post the following notice at the equipment panel in the cargo control room: “IN CASE OF IG FAILURE CARGO OPERATION TO BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY”

Note: This applies also to tank cleaning, COW and slop decanting operations

- Always follow this policy.

- In case of IGS failure:

- Take immediate recovery action.

- Inform charterers, company, terminal immediately

- If the inert gas system is unable to meet operational requirements and it is impossible to carry out a repair locally, then resume cargo discharge, de-ballasting, and necessary tank cleaning only when the emergency conditions laid below are complied with and in agreement with the terminal:

- For crude oil, maintain tanks in the inerted condition to avoid the danger of pyrophoric iron sulphide ignition. If tanks cannot be maintained in an inerted condition, connect an external supply of inert gas to the system to avoid air being drawn into the cargo tanks.

- For products, resume cargo discharge only if an external supply of inert gas is connected.

- For chemical cargoes, stop all cargo handling, cleaning, and ballasting operations.

- Place a relevant warning poster in a conspicuous place in the CCR.

- Close the deck-isolating valve.

Caution: Do not resume cargo operations, including tank cleaning, until the IG has been restored to normal operations or an alternative source of IG has been provided (e.g., IG supplied from shore).

- If unable to provide an external IGS source or to repair the inert gas system on an inerted product or chemical carrier (which has not carried a cargo of crude oil since the tanks were previously washed), do not resume discharge until the written agreement of all interested parties has been obtained. Take the following precautions to justify the continuation of cargo operations:

- Check that approved devices, or flame screens are fitted and in good order to prevent the passage of flame into cargo tanks.

- Ensure the valves on the mast risers are opened.

- No free fall of water or slops is permitted.

- Do not introduce equipment for dipping, ullaging, or sampling into the tank until five hours have elapsed since the injection of inert gas ceased.

- If essential for the safety of the operation, do this only after 30 minutes have elapsed and ensure all metal components are securely earthed (see also IMO Inert Gas Systems 8.3).

Note: If employing the option described in point 4, contact the operations department to obtain approval for discharge without inert gas. Submit a thorough risk assessment to the operations department.

Note: Refer also to Chapter 8.1.10 – “Special Cargoes” – Handling Static Accumulator cargoes (precautions against electrostatic discharge)

###### Supply of Inert Gas from Extertnal Source (Shore)

Arrangements are provided to enable the inert gas main to be connected to an external supply of inert gas.

The arrangements consist of a 250 mm nominal pipe size bolted flange, isolated from the inert gas main by a valve and located forward of the non-return valve.

In case of failure of IGS/IGG where an external source of inert gas is available (from shore), follow the procedure:

- Cease all cargo operations.

- Close the main IG isolation valve.

- Open the vent valve between the main IG isolation valve and gas regulating valve.

- Do not allow cargo tanks to reach vacuum.

- Inform the terminal, company, and charterers.

- Request inert gas supply from the terminal.

- Connect the inert gas hose provided by the terminal to the designated flange for external supply.

- Agree with the terminal on the pressure of inert gas to be supplied and oxygen content.

- Measure and confirm all tanks' oxygen content below 8% by volume.

- If not, purge the required cargo tanks below 8% by volume.

- If oxygen is within required limits, resume cargo operations in close communication with the terminal.

Note: If the vessel is not equipped with the above arrangements (250 mm nominal pipe size), connect the inert gas supply hose provided by the terminal to either the emergency IG connection designated for inerting double-hull spaces and located after the IG main non-return valve, or to the vapor manifold.

##### Maintenance of IGS/IGG

The chief officer and the second engineer shall:

- Maintain the inert gas system in full working order.

- Regularly inspect, as per the DANAOS planned maintenance program and manufacturer’s manual:

- Scrubber tower

- Blowers

- Gas regulating valve

- Deck seal

- P/V breakers

- P/V valves

- Mast risers

- Oxygen analyser

- Pumps

- Non-return valves/flaps

- Drain the IGS lines every 6 months and inspect for corrosion/leakage.

- Enter all reports carefully in PMS – DANAOS.

- Maintain an IGS maintenance log using the form available in “PMS reports.”

- Test IGS before every operation and under specified periods as per PMS.

It is important to ensure that non-return barriers (e.g., deck water seal, non-return valves/flaps, etc.) function correctly so that there is no possibility of petroleum gas or liquid passing back to the machinery space.

Refer to the ship's operations manual, the manufacturer’s instructions, and the installation drawings for details on the operation, inspection, and testing of a particular system.

Consult the IMO publication “Guidelines for Inert Gas Systems” for a more detailed explanation of the design and operation of a typical IG system.

##### Cold weather precautions for IGS/IGG

The IG system may not work properly in extreme cold weather.

In such weather, any water in the IG may freeze in the IG main.

The system should be operated to minimize residual water and should be closely monitored.

Air-operated control valves, where the control air has a high-water vapor content, may not operate correctly if exposed to extremely low ambient temperatures.

Air-operated control valves should be exercised/operated regularly to ensure correct operation. Water separators in control air systems should be drained frequently, and the control air dryers should be checked regularly for proper operation.

In extremely cold weather, ice may prevent the P/V valves from operating and may block the flame screens on the P/V valves and mast risers.

Water-filled P/V breakers should be filled to the appropriate level with antifreeze liquid.

Deck water seals are fitted with heating coils that should be used before entering zones with a cold climate.

##### Protection against Tank Over/Under Pressurization

###### Introduction

Prepare a table with maximum permissible loading rates for each cargo and ballast tank.

If tanks have a combined venting system, for each group of cargo or ballast tanks.

This ensures tanks are not over or under-pressurized by exceeding the capacity of the venting system, including secondary venting arrangements.

Note: Display the table in the cargo control room. Precautions against static electricity hazards and pipeline erosion are described in ISGOTT Section 7.3.3.2 (ISGOTT 7.3.3).

###### P/V Valves

P/V valves are the primary means of protecting tanks against over and under pressurization.

Each cargo tank is normally equipped with its own P/V valve for full protection if isolated from the main common vapor system on board.

These valves connect to the tank’s atmosphere, with venting typically at least 2 meters above the deck.

To prevent mechanical damage, the closing pressure of these valves is controlled by a damping mechanism to avoid hammering.

Note:

Keep P/V and IG valves operational.

Inform the operations department of any issues affecting system efficiency.

On the vacuum side, the valves have flame arresters to prevent flames or sparks from entering the cargo tanks.

The screens are made of corrosion-resistant wire-woven fabric with a 20x20 mesh size. Two screens are fitted between 0.5 and 1.5 inches apart.

- Inspect and test P/V valves before every cargo-related operation (loading, unloading, tank cleaning, etc.) and at intervals prescribed in the PMS and manufacturer's instructions.

- Maintain flame arresters clean and replace if damaged or blocked.

- Keep proper records of inspection, testing, and maintenance of P/V valves as per PMS.

- Perform regular maintenance/overhaul as per PMS and the manufacturer's instructions.

- Keep required spares as per PMS.

- In case of any P/V valve failure, inform TSI and MSI and follow up as advised.

###### IG Isolating Valves

Each cargo tank can be isolated from the main IG line by operating an individual IG branch isolation valve.

Each valve must have a positive locking arrangement.

The status of the IG isolation valves (i.e., “open” or “close”) shall be shown in the CCR on a mimic diagram or other suitable means (board, drawing).

The keys to the locking devices shall be kept by the C/O, who ensures these valves are not operated without permission.

Periodically verify operation/tightness and perform maintenance as per the manufacturer’s recommendations.

###### P/V Breaker

The single P/V breaker is located on the common vapor pipeline, serving the entire cargo tank branch pipelines, ending at the vessel’s mast riser. A P/V breaker on the IG main may serve as secondary venting:

- For homogenous cargo.

- For compatible multiple cargoes not requiring isolation.

If the venting arrangements are free-flow type and the masthead isolation valve is closed during unloading:

- The IG system serves as primary under-pressure protection.

- The P/V breaker serves as secondary under-pressure protection.

In the event of rapid pressure fluctuation within the common vapor system, the P/V breaker relieves over-pressure. It should not operate at a lower pressure than the secondary venting system fitted to the individual cargo tanks.

Each P/V breaker should be marked with:

- Design pressure and vacuum opening settings.

- Date of last inspection.

- Type/quantity of anti-freeze and lowest allowable ambient temperature.

In the event of an excessive pressure surge within the tank vapor system, the water column will either:

- Be displaced onto the deck in case of excessive pressure.

- Be drawn into the cargo tanks in case of under-pressure.

Notes:

Some vessels may have alternate approved arrangements. Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The entire vapor system will open to the external environment, relieving pressure quickly. This safety mechanism operates if the vessel’s P/V valves fail or are insufficient to relieve the pressure surge adequately.

Once the P/V breaker operates, it reduces the tank vapor system pressure to atmospheric, exposing it to oxygen. This system is a last resort to prevent tanker structural damage. On some vessels, the P/V breaker can be replaced by a breather valve with the same function.

Inspect and check the P/V breaker level:

- Before every cargo-related operation (loading, unloading, tank cleaning, etc.).

- At intervals prescribed in PMS.

Maintain proper records of inspection, testing, and maintenance of the P/V breaker as per PMS. Always maintain the P/V breaker liquid at the required level. Follow the instruction manual regarding the water and anti-freeze ratio to avoid freezing in cold climates.

Where a breather valve is fitted instead of a P/V breaker, inspect and test it:

- Before every cargo-related operation (loading, unloading, tank cleaning, etc.).

- At intervals prescribed in PMS.

Maintain records of inspection, testing, and maintenance of the breather valve as per PMS. Perform regular maintenance/overhaul of the breather valve as per PMS and the manufacturer's instructions.

###### Mast / Vent Riser

Most tankers are equipped with low-velocity venting risers at least 6 meters above the deck, positioned to prevent the accumulation of flammable atmospheres on the tank deck or around accommodation and engine rooms during vapor release.

The mast riser is the common venting device for the entire venting system.

When loading homogeneous cargo, the mast riser is typically used for vapor release instead of individual P/V valves.

Inspection and Maintenance:

- Inspect the mast riser and test the riser isolation valve before every cargo-related operation (loading, unloading, tank cleaning, etc.) and at intervals prescribed in the PMS and manufacturer's instructions.

- Maintain records of inspection, testing, and maintenance of the mast riser as per PMS.

- Perform regular maintenance of the isolation valve and overhaul the mast riser as per PMS and manufacturer's instructions.

- Periodically verify the flame screen and replace it if damaged or clogged.

###### Flame Screens

All low-velocity venting devices (cargo, bunker, ballast) are equipped with flame screens.

A flame screen is a device incorporating corrosion-resistant wire-woven fabrics of very small mesh, preventing sparks from entering a tank or vent opening and temporarily preventing the passage of flame.

When tanks are being filled, tank headspace gas will be displaced through the vent pipes.

Ensure flame screens are in good condition and there are no ignition sources near vent outlets.

Flame screens on P/V valves (vacuum side) and mast riser can clog during venting, depending on the cargo properties.

Freezing in cold weather can also clog flame screens, necessitating more frequent checks.

Always maintain flame screens in good condition. Immediately replace holed, torn, or rusted flame screens.

Inspection and Maintenance:

Visually inspect all flame screens before every cargo-related operation and at intervals prescribed in PMS.

Maintain records of inspection and replacement.

###### Pressure Sensors

Pressure sensors, if present, are secondary means of protecting tanks against over and under pressurization.

These sensors may be fitted in each tank protected by the primary P/V valve arrangement.

The monitoring system is in the ship's cargo control room or the position from which cargo operations are normally carried out.

This equipment provides an alarm facility activated by detecting over-pressure or under-pressure conditions within a tank.

###### Alarm Settings of Secondary Venting System

In inerted vessels without vapor line connected:

High Pressure Alarm: When the tank pressure reaches 10% greater than the normal actuation settings of the pressure valves.

Low Pressure Alarm: Pressure should never fall below zero, alarm should be set above zero at 100 mmWg or more.

In inerted vessels with vapor line connected:

High Pressure Alarm: When the tank pressure reaches 80% of the lowest pressure relief valve setting in the cargo tank venting system.

Low Pressure Alarm: Not less than four inches water gauge (0.144 psig) or 100 mmWg.

In non-inerted vessels without vapor line connected:

High Pressure Alarm: 10% greater than the normal actuation settings of the pressure valves.

Low Pressure Alarm: 10% greater vacuum than the normal actuation settings of the vacuum valves.

In non-inerted vessels with vapor line connected:

High Pressure Alarm: 80% of the lowest pressure relief valve setting in the cargo tank venting system.

Low Pressure Alarm: At the lowest vacuum relief valve setting in the cargo tank venting system.

Note:

When vapor line is not connected, the alarm pressure setting refers to each individual cargo tank pressure sensor setting.

When vapor return line is connected, the alarm pressure setting refers to the common IG line (or vapor return line) pressure sensor/alarm device.

Record the alarm settings and display them conspicuously on deck.

Test and calibrate individual cargo tank pressure sensors at intervals prescribed in PMS and maintain records of tests and calibration as per form TANK 25.

Test audible and visual alarm indications of each individual pressure sensor before starting cargo-related operations (loading, unloading, tank cleaning, etc.). Maintain records of tests.

##### Tank Pressure Increase

###### Abnormal High-Pressure Procedure

The Chief Officer and OOW shall:

- Investigate any abnormal trend of pressure increase, even if the high-pressure alarm has not being triggered.

- Take appropriate action until the cause of pressure increase is identified and resolved.

- If necessary, stop cargo operation.

- Address over-pressurization issues before any high-pressure alarm activates.

####### Actions in case of High-Pressure Alarm activation

- Suspend cargo transfer operations in coordination with the terminal.

- Instruct personnel working nearby to keep clear of the deck or take suitable measures (e.g., using breathing apparatus and gas detectors).

- Closely monitor tank pressure.

- Inform the Master and C/O as applicable.

- Investigate the cause of the abnormal pressure increase.

- The Master should inform the operations or technical department.

##### Tank Pressure Loss

###### Abnormal Low-Pressure Procedure

The Chief Officer and OOW shall:

- Investigate any abnormal trend of pressure loss, even if the low-pressure alarm has not yet sounded.

- Take appropriate action until the cause of pressure loss is identified and resolved.

- If necessary, slow down or stop cargo pumps.

- Address under-pressurization issues before any low-pressure alarm activates.

####### Actions in case of Low-Pressure Alarm activation

- Inform the Master and C/O as applicable.

- Suspend cargo transfer operations in coordination with the terminal.

- Instruct EOOW to check the IG system function and call the senior engineer.

- Closely monitor tank pressures.

- Investigate the cause of abnormal pressure loss.

- The Master should inform the operations or technical department.

##### Isolation of cargo tanks

The Chief Officer is directly responsible for the operation, maintenance, testing, and control of individual cargo tanks' IG isolation valves as part of the common venting system.

Cargo tanks may be isolated from the main IG line for:

- Preserving cargo integrity (avoiding cross-contamination between different grades of cargo via the vapor line)

- Inerting/purging

- Gas freeing

The Chief Officer shall:

- Ensure all IG branches are maintained and fully operational.

- Ensure clear visual indication of the operational status of IG branches is available on the valve body for easy identification.

- Ensure the operational status of each IG branch is available in CCR for quick reference (e.g., mimic diagram, designated board).

- Maintain IG branches locking arrangements operational.

- Check and confirm the operational status of all IG branches prior to any cargo-related operation.

- Perform regular maintenance of individual IG branches as per PMS intervals/instructions and as needed.

- Keep appropriate records of inspection, maintenance, and tests as per PMS.

Note: Isolation valves' locking keys shall be kept in the custody of the Chief Officer only.

Caution: Incorrect settings of individual IG branch valves can lead to over or under pressurization of cargo tanks. Personnel allowed to operate the IG branches should be clearly instructed. After setting the IG branches in the required position, their status should be verified by the person in charge and valves must be locked to prevent unauthorized operation.

###### Depressurization of Cargo Tanks

Tanks can be depressurized, before and after cargo loading and discharging operations, for:

- Control measurements

- Gauging

- Sampling

####### Precautions during tanks depressurization

- No cargo or ballast operations are carried out.

- Depressurization is achieved through the vent post and/or individual P/V valves.

- Tanks are immediately re-pressurized with IG after gauging or sampling.

- Equipment used is properly earthed.

- Tank pressure should remain positive (minimum 100mmWG).

In case of depressurization:

- Close the tank IG supply valves.

- Indicate the status of the IG tank valve on the appropriate indicator panel in the CCR.

- Fit each individual tank IG valve with a locking device under the control of the C/O.

- Take precautions due to the possible presence of toxic/flammable cargoes at deck level.

- All personnel involved shall wear proper PPE as necessary, mentioned in the appropriate cargo MSDS.

If required to depressurize inerted tanks on arrival in port, do the venting before arrival and as far offshore as practical.

If required to vent tanks during loading operations, obtain permission from the local harbor master/authority before venting.

The OOW should inform the terminal personnel to implement relevant safeguards and get their approval.

If operating under a closed system, depressurizing the cargo tanks to facilitate sampling/measuring is not necessary.

Advise the terminal accordingly and inform the company in case of disagreement.

Caution: Pressure in the tank should remain positive (minimum 100mmWG). This is important in case of IGS failure.\

##### Vapour Emission Control System (VECS) Operation

###### Vapor Return / Vapor Balancing

Test the vapor tightness at least annually or before calling at a US port, and prior to loading sensitive, toxic, or flammable cargo.

Maintain records using form TANK-28A and issue a Vapor Tightness Certificate using form TANK 28.

The vapor collection system should control VOC vapours emitted from crude oil, gasoline blends, benzene, and other liquid cargoes during various tanker operations, including loading, ballasting, lightering, degassing, purging, venting, and tank cleaning.

Caution: Vapor balancing is prohibited when the cargo tanks on a vessel discharging cargo are inerted, and the cargo tanks on a vessel receiving cargo are not inerted.

During transfer operations:

If the cargo tanks are inerted on a vessel discharging cargo to a receiving vessel with inerted cargo tanks, the service vessel shall:

Inert the vapor transfer hose before transferring cargo vapor.

Have an oxygen analyzer with a sensor or sampling connection within 3 meters of the vessel vapor connection that:

Activates a visible and audible alarm on the service vessel when the oxygen content in the vapor collection system exceeds 8% by volume for vapor of crude oil, gasoline blends, or benzene.

Has an oxygen concentration indicator on the service vessel.

Has a connection for injecting a span gas of known concentration for calibration and testing of the oxygen analyzer.

If the cargo tanks are not inerted on a vessel discharging cargo, and the cargo is flammable or combustible, the vapor collection line on the service vessel shall have a detonation arrester within 3 meters of the vessel vapor connection.

An electrical insulating flange or one length of non-conductive hose shall be provided between the vessel vapor connection on each vessel operating a vessel-to-vessel cargo transfer.

The Chief Officer (as PIC) shall:

- Be fully familiar with the ship-specific VECS design and operation.

- Be familiar with the line diagram of the tanker’s vapor collection piping indicating the locations and purpose of all control and safety devices.

- Be familiar with the maximum allowable transfer rate as limited by the venting capacity of the pressure or vacuum relief valves, or any other limiting factor.

- Be familiar with the maximum pressure drop in the vessel’s vapor collection system for various transfer rates.

- Be familiar with the relief settings of each pressure and vacuum valve.

- Be familiar with the settings of secondary venting systems (pressure sensors, where applicable).

- Be familiar with pre-transfer procedures.

- Be familiar with procedures for handling faults during vapor collection operations.

- Have completed training on the specific system installed on the tanker.

Training in VESC operations shall cover:

- Purpose and principles of the vapor emission control system.

- Understanding of equipment and associated hazards.

- Understanding of operating procedures, including:

- Testing and inspection of equipment.

- Pre-transfer procedures.

- Piping connection sequence.

- Start-up procedures.

- Normal operations and emergency procedures.

Note: Procedures to follow in the event of VECS faults are covered under "Protection against tank Under/Over pressurization".

###### Vapour Recovery / Vapour Balancing Procedure

The Chief Officer shall:

- Conduct a risk assessment and hold a toolbox talk with all crew members to ensure understanding of operation and specific procedures.

- If the vessel does not have a VECS alarm system, set individual COT vapor pressure sensors to actuate the alarm at required values.

Note: USCG regulations require the high-level alarm to actuate at 80% of the P/V pressure setting.

During vessel-to-vessel transfer operations:

- Connect each cargo tank being loaded by the vapor collection system to a cargo tank being discharged.

- Connect the shore recovery line to the ship’s VECS manifold.

Note: The VECS manifold is provided with a 2.5 cm long stud to prevent connection of a cargo line to it.

- If the cargo tanks on both the vessel discharging cargo and the vessel receiving cargo are inerted:

- Test each tank on the vessel receiving cargo, connected to the vapor collection system, before cargo transfer to ensure the oxygen content in the vapor space does not exceed 8% by volume for vapor of crude oil, gasoline blends, or benzene.

Note: Measure the oxygen content of each tank at a point one meter below the tank top and at a point equal to one-half of the ullage.

- Do not exceed the maximum allowable cargo transfer rate determined by:

- 80% of the total venting capacity of the pressure relief valves in the cargo tank venting system.

- The total vacuum relieving capacity of the vacuum relief valves in the cargo tank venting system.

- The rate based on pressure drop calculations at which, for a given pressure at the receiving facility/vessel vapor connection, the pressure in any cargo tank connected to the vapor collection system exceeds 80% of the setting of any pressure relief valve in the cargo tank venting system.

- Continuously monitor the oxygen content of vapours being transferred during the operation. Terminate the cargo transfer if the oxygen content exceeds 8% by volume. Do not restart until the oxygen content in the tanks of the vessel receiving cargo is reduced to 8% by volume or less.

- Purge the vapor transfer hose of air and inert before starting vapor transfer.

- Do not open the isolation valve on the service vessel until the pressure in the vapor collection system on the vessel receiving cargo exceeds the pressure in the vapor collection system.



### 8.1.6 Cargo Vapour Emissions - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Cargo Vapour Emissions

###### Introduction

- Record vapour releases in the VOC management plan and SEEMP II on crude oil tankers.

Note: Ensure all gauging systems and readouts in the Cargo Control Room (CCR) are functional. Carry out calibration of gauges and level sensing equipment as per PMS and manufacturer’s instructions.



### 8.1.7 Tank Cleaning - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Tank Cleaning

###### Introduction

Follow safety measures and procedures described in ISGOTT and TSCG for efficient tank cleaning and protection of the environment.

Refer to the tank cleaning guide HM 50 and/or SHELL Tank Cleaning Guidelines, part of the company’s IMS (for oil tankers) and the Milbros software (for chemical tankers).

These publications provide information for proper tank cleaning preparation, including:

Method of cleaning

Cargo/type IMO category

Paint resistance list

Prewashing information

Handling/stowage and disposal of washings at sea

Relevant regulations

Note: Vessel management should cooperate to jointly plan and carry out the tank cleaning operation.

Cleaning of some or all tanks may be required due to:

Cargo grade change

Minimum MARPOL requirements

Ballasting in adverse weather conditions (to meet clean ballast requirements)

Preparing cargo tanks for loading non-compatible cargoes

Removal of sediment that may prevent effective draining of tanks and make gas freeing difficult

Tank inspection and/or repair

Dry dock preparation

Excessive tank cleaning is uneconomic and may increase difficulty in meeting pollution control requirements during load-on-top operations.

Do not wash tanks for cargo grades unless ordered. In clean oil trade (CPP), wash tanks to meet grade requirements as per company instructions for the intended voyage.

###### Evaluation of the Need for Cargo Tank Cleaning

Clean cargo tanks only when necessary, considering:

Guidelines in these instructions

Instructions from charterer

Special instructions from the company

Evaluation of specific conditions by vessel management

Observe local regulations strictly. If tank cleaning is done alongside a terminal or tank cleaning installation, discuss safety and environment protection matters with shore installation representatives before operations start.

###### Operations Before and After Tank Cleaning

Flushing of pipelines: Before starting tank cleaning, wash pumps and pipelines and transfer the wash water to slop tanks.

Draining of pipelines: Drain water from tanks, pipelines, and pumps after tank cleaning.

Gas Freeing: Prepare cargo tanks for carrying low flashpoint products by purging tanks, lines, and pumps with inert gas and air until gas-free.

Items Lost in Tanks: Remove items such as ropes, probes, sounding rods, sampling equipment, tools, and the like from the tank to prevent them from being sucked into the pipeline system, possibly damaging pumps and valves.

Follow correct tank entry procedures.

##### Safety Instructions for Tank Cleaning

During tank cleaning:

Inform crew members that tank cleaning is about to start.

Minimize the crew working on other jobs on the main deck.

Operate the pump room mechanical ventilation throughout tank cleaning.

Keep openings of unwashed and non-gas-free tanks closed.

Before starting, check all valves are correctly set, and the tank is stripped dry.

Portable machines: Flush tank washing hoses with clean seawater, with machines fitted, before use. Measure the continuity of the tank washing hoses to ensure the bonding wire woven into the fabric is intact. All hoses supplied for tank washing machines should be tested for electrical continuity in a dry condition before use. The resistance should not exceed six ohms per meter length. Couplings should be connected to the hose in a way that ensures effective bonding.

Minimize the transfer of gas and air from tanks being washed to the slop tank.

Use the stripping pump if the eductor cannot reduce gas and air transfer to the slop tank. Electrically charged mist can form in a slop tank. If unable to maintain the slop tank atmosphere in inert condition, comply with ISGOTT & TSCG restrictions about using sounding rods or other objects after tank washing.

The stripping pump is preferred to eductors due to the smaller volume of liquid throughput, aiding the separation process in cascade slop tanks.

###### Tank Atmospheres

####### Inert Atmosphere

The tank atmosphere is maintained with an oxygen level reduced below 8% by volume.

The oxygen content must never exceed 8% by volume in the tanks and 5% by volume in the IGS lines.

Note: In the inert atmosphere, the oxygen side of the fire triangle is physically removed and controlled.

Tankers carrying MARPOL Annex I cargo shall wash cargo tanks only under inert atmosphere conditions, with oxygen concentration less than 8% vol.

Tank cleaning operations shall be carried out as per procedures and instructions provided by this IMS chapter and ISGOTT section 11.1.6.9.

####### Non-Inert Atmosphere

The tank atmosphere has oxygen levels above 8% by volume. This is common to:

Tankers carrying MARPOL Annex II flammable cargo that do not require inert gas for transportation

Tankers that do not have access to IG on board or from shore

Tank washing and gas freeing operations in non-inert atmospheres present increased risks due to static electricity.

##### Tank Cleaning Planning

Master shall conduct a meeting of the ship’s safety and environmental committee for planning tank cleaning operations, including:

Master

Chief Engineer

Chief Officer

2nd Engineer

Pumpman

Discuss all matters associated with tank cleaning and decide how to proceed with the operation. The topics shall include:

Study available instructions from the company or the charterers

Ensure necessary equipment for tank cleaning is in order

Prepare the tank cleaning procedure based on the last cargo discharged and the vessel's next employment

Estimate available time and expected duration of tank cleaning

Fix the time to start preparation of boilers, pumps, etc., and, where necessary, the tank cleaning preheater

The Chief Officer shall:

Prepare a risk assessment for the tank cleaning operation, considering all involved hazards and respective mitigating measures.

Familiarize all involved personnel with the risk assessment and give thorough instructions on their roles and responsibilities.

Prepare a detailed tank cleaning plan using form TANK 36 “Tank Cleaning Plan.”

Carry out appropriate checks as per the checklists:

TANK 37

TANK 38

TANK 39

Monitor the tank atmosphere during tank cleaning and record it in form TANK 40.

Record the cleaning process in form TANK 34 "Tank Cleaning Schedule."

Include the following in the tank cleaning plans:

Hours of operation

Manpower required

Change of ballast

Need for gas freeing

Treatment/storage of slops

Bunker consumption

Determine if work is required round-the-clock or if it can be done within normal working hours .

Note: Consider all expenses associated with tank cleaning. Utilize manpower and fuel oil resources in the most efficient way.

The Chief Officer shall supervise the actual tank cleaning, complying with all safety regulations and other directions.

###### Communication / Reporting

Send the Tank Cleaning Plan to Office for review.

When tank cleaning starts, the Master should inform the office regarding:

Date tank cleaning instructions received

Date tank cleaning safety committee operation meeting held

Expected time for the completion of the procedure

Expected quantity of slops and expected bunker consumption

During the tank cleaning operation, inform the office daily about:

The progress of the cleaning

The schedule for completion of the work

###### Hot Water Washing

Hot washing can be very effective in removing sludge residues.

The wash water should be at the cargo pour point plus about 40 degrees centigrade.

Alternatively, estimate the appropriate hot wash temperature by heating a sample of sludge and water until melting occurs. Heat the wash water to this melt-temperature plus around 20 degrees centigrade.

The total number of machines used simultaneously for hot washing will be governed by the heating capacity of the tank cleaning heater and/or slop tank heating coils in the case of closed-cycle cleaning.

###### Typical Tank Cleaning Cycle for Oil/Product Tankers

Tank cleaning steps on Oil Tankers are normally as follows:

Ensure tanks atmosphere contain less than 8% Vol of Oxygen

Wash all cargo lines

Tank clean with hot/warm water (depending on the pour point of the cargo)

Strip tanks to Slop concurrently with the tank cleaning (maintain tanks bottom always with minimum wash water quantity)

Rinse tanks with fresh water to remove salt deposits and strip tanks concurrently

Drain all lines and strip to Slop Tank

Purge tanks with IG until the HC content drops below 2% Vol

Ventilate with fresh air (install air ducts for more efficiency)

Prepare the tank for entry / mopping (refer to Enclosed Space Entry Permit procedure).

Note: Tank cleaning procedure may differ due to properties of last cargo and cargo to be loaded

###### Usage of Portable Tank Cleaning Machines

Check the conductivity of the portable hoses (resistance should not exceed 6 ohms per metre length)

Connect cleaning hoses to the hydrants.

Check and connect the Monel wires before lowering the portable tank cleaning machines into the tank.

Wash a tank without stoppage until washing cycle is completed.

Check frequently to ensure that all machines rotate and that the tank is kept stripped.

If there is a build-up of wash water, stop the washing and resume only when the tank is stripped dry.

Stop tank cleaning if the machines strike against bulkheads, etc., due to rolling or pitching.

Remove tank washing machines and hoses after washing of the tank is finished.

Remove machines from the tank before disconnecting hoses and bonding wire.

Note: on Chemical Tankers, if tanks do not require ballasting a pre-wash is not required for IMO Category Y and Z chemical cargoes.

###### Recirculation Cleaning

Recirculation of wash water is required when the same cleaning water is re-used after stripped from the cargo tanks, via the Slop Tank.

Achieve the necessary temperature using heating coils.

Caution: Do not use cleaning additives unless agreed with Office.

Static accumulators could generate substantial charges during recirculation cleaning and lead to electrostatic discharge. Ensure that oxygen content in the tanks to be washed and in the Slop Tanks is below 8% Vol during the entire operation.

###### Carbon Black Feedstock

Cleanliness requirements for each cargo differ. Follow the charterer's specific instructions regarding tank cleanliness and preparation.

A typical tank cleaning cycle is applicable, unless advised otherwise by Office.

Maintain a record of work hours, material, and fuel used for tank cleaning for carbon black.

Note: These may be for the charterer's account.

###### Decanting of Slops

Decant and reduce the quantity of wash water from the slop tanks.

Use the ODME when pumping any water from the cargo or slop system. Follow the procedure for using ODME as detailed in Chapter 6.2.1.

###### Trim / List During Washing

Improve tank draining and efficient stripping by:

Keeping adequate trim by stern

Listing the vessel ½° - 1° towards the tank suction

###### Tank Cleaning Guide Tables

Detailed guidelines for cleaning coated/uncoated tanks and preparing tanks for loading various cargo grades are given in the HM 50 Tank Cleaning Guide and/or SHELL Tank Cleaning Guidelines.

HM 50 is the primary and preferred Tank Cleaning Guide. On a case-by-case basis, after further study and consultation with the marine and safety superintendent, SHELL Tank Cleaning Guidelines may be used.

###### Tank Cleaning in Non-Inerted Atmosphere

Non-inert cargo tank washing should only be done when both the source of ignition and the flammability (fuel) of the tank atmosphere are controlled, as we cannot eliminate the oxygen from the fire triangle. Follow these procedures:

Controlling the fuel inside the tank:

Before washing:

Flush the tank bottom with water so all parts are covered, then strip. Do not use the tank washing machines.

Flush the piping system with water (including cargo pumps, crossovers, and discharge lines). Drain the flushing water to the designated slop.

Ventilate the tank using bonded portable fans to reduce the gas concentration to 10% or less of the LFL. Test for gas at various levels, being aware that pockets of flammable gas may exist.

Start washing only when the tank atmosphere reaches 10% or less of the LFL.

During washing:

Monitor the change in LFL percentage by testing the atmosphere frequently and at various levels inside the tank.

Consider suspending washing to take readings as water can affect the efficiency of gas detectors.

Provide a free flow of air from one end of the tank to the other with continuous mechanical ventilation.

Maintain the tank atmosphere at not more than 35% LFL. If the gas level reaches 35% at any measured location within a tank, immediately stop the washing in that tank.

Resume washing only when continued ventilation has reduced the gas concentration to 10% or less of the LFL and can maintain it.

Isolate any tank with a venting system common to other tanks to prevent gas transfer from other tanks.

Controlling the source of ignition:

Restrict the output of individual tank washing machines to no more than 60 m3/hr.

Keep the total water output per cargo tank as low as practicable and do not exceed 180 m3/hr.

Keep the tank drained during washing. Do not allow water accumulation inside the tank.

Do not use the recirculation method for washing.

Heated wash water may be used but stop immediately if the gas concentration reaches 35% of the LFL.

Increase the frequency of gas concentration measurements if the hot wash water temperature is above 60°C.

Chemical additives can be used only if the temperature of the wash water does not exceed 60°C.

Do not inject steam into a tank that may contain hydrocarbon vapors and is in a non-inert condition. Consider injecting steam only when the tank is gas-free.

Always keep the flow of wash water into the designated slop tank below the liquid level in that tank. Do not allow free fall of wash water into the slop tank.

Static accumulator oils should always be completely pumped out of the tank before washing. Spraying water in a tank containing static accumulator oil can generate static electricity at the liquid surface.

Test the electrical continuity of all tank cleaning hoses before introducing any portable washing machines to the tank. Do not introduce any portable washing machines until the LFL level is 10% or less.

Ensure that any metallic components of the sounding rod or other equipment are bonded and securely earthed to the ship before introducing them to the tank and that they remain earthed until removed.

Observe all listed precautions during washing and for five (5) hours afterward to allow enough time for any mist carrying a static charge to dissipate. If the tank is continuously mechanically ventilated after washing, this can be reduced to one (1) hour.

Do not allow the use of any non-intrinsically safe equipment on deck and take precautions to eliminate the risk of mechanical sparks produced by dropping metallic equipment, etc.

Note: The same procedure applies for washing cargo tanks with an uncertain atmosphere if reducing the oxygen concentration below 8% vol is not possible.

- SHELL Tank cleaning guidelines

- ISGOTT Figure 12.4: “Steps to control the fuel (flammable vapours) while washing in a non-inert tank atmosphere flowchart”.

##### Purging and Gas Freeing

Take special care during gas freeing operations. Purge tanks with inert gas before gas freeing. Reduce the hydrocarbon content to 2% or less by volume, so that during subsequent gas freeing no part of the tank atmosphere is brought within the flammable range (refer to form from Ship Forms Manual). After purging, gas free the tank to meet ISGOTT requirements for tank entry, hot work, or cold work.

The Chief Officer is responsible for this operation. He shall brief all crew regarding the safety measures to be followed on deck.

During purging/gas freeing operations, refer to the flammability diagram shown below.

###### Purging / Methods of Replacing Tank Atmosphere

Purge tanks in inerted condition to reduce the existing:

Oxygen content

Hydrocarbon gas content

Note: This avoids combustion if air is later introduced into the tank. Replace a tank atmosphere with inert gas by either:

Dilution method

Displacement method

Note: Consider gas densities when deciding on the method. From heaviest to lightest: HC, IG, H2S, Air, CO.

Take oxygen or gas measurements at several heights and horizontal positions within the tank to check the efficiency of the purging operation.

A mixture of inert gas and petroleum gas, when vented and mixed with air, can become flammable. Take normal safety precautions when petroleum gas is vented from a tank.

Measure the hydrocarbon content with an appropriate meter designed to measure the percentage of hydrocarbon gas in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere.

Use form TANK 21 to maintain records of gas inerting during the purging operation.

###### Dilution Method

The incoming inert gas mixes with the original tank atmosphere to form a homogeneous mixture throughout the tank.

The process requires maximum turbulence in the tank. The incoming gas must have sufficient entry velocity to penetrate to the tank bottom.

Limit the tanks being simultaneously inerted to ensure maximum turbulence.

###### Displacement Method

This method is the most time and economically efficient.

The inert gas, which is slightly lighter than hydrocarbon gas, is introduced at the top of the tank. The heavier hydrocarbon gas is pushed out via the bottom piping.

This method requires a very low entry velocity to produce a stable horizontal interface between the incoming and escaping gas.

Several tanks can be purged simultaneously.

Inerting or purging through a series of tanks is called the cascade method, where the IG enters the first tank and exits to the second tank. Using this method, the tanks are inerted/purged from top to bottom or from bottom to top.

###### Inerting Empty Tanks

Gas-Free Tanks:

Chosen the most efficient method (dilution or displacement) considering the available venting and cargo system arrangements.

When inerting empty tanks that are gas free, introduce IG while venting the air in the tank.

Continue this operation until the oxygen content throughout the tank is not more than 8% by volume.

Keep all tanks connected to the IG main and maintain pressurized at a positive pressure of at least 100 mmWG.

Non-Gas-Free Tanks:

If the tank is not gas-free, follow precautions against static electricity (see ISGOTT section 11.1.6.8) until the oxygen content of the tank has been reduced to 8% by volume.

If individual tanks have to be isolated from the common line (e.g., for product integrity), periodically verify the pressure in the isolated tanks and:

Vent excess pressure through individual P/V valves

Restore pressure by using IG to top-up by connecting only the required tanks to the IG Main

Maintain vapor pressure in the tanks above 100 mmWG.

###### Gas Freeing Methods

In a gas freeing operation, air is delivered into the tank to mix with the existing tank atmosphere and mix together any layers present.

The resultant mixture is expelled to the outside atmosphere. The process is one of continuous dilution with air; the highest hydrocarbon concentration is vented at the beginning of gas freeing and decreases thereafter.

On inerted ships start gas freeing only after the tanks are purged with IG until HC content is below 2% Vol.

Air ducts used for gas freeing purposes must be fully bonded to avoid the buildup of a static charge.

Gas freeing is required on product carriers for:

Tank entry

Inspection, especially in port

Venting the vapors of previous cargoes

Purging is not required before gas freeing when the hydrocarbon gas content of a tank is already below 2% by volume.

Control the degree of ventilation and the number of openings to produce an exit velocity sufficient to carry the gas clear of the deck.

Maintain venting until the required gas-free condition is attained.

Use portable fans for delivering air to the tank through tank cleaning openings. Portable fans may be hydraulically, pneumatically, or steam driven. The IGS fans have less effect and penetration than the portable units.

Portable fans combined with the IG fans are the quickest and most efficient way to reach the required gas-free condition. Follow the written plan for the gas freeing operation.

####### Precautions During Gas-Freeing Operations

Tank cleaning and gas freeing are the most hazardous periods of tanker operations. The additional risk from the toxic effect of petroleum gas during this period cannot be overemphasized and must be impressed on all concerned.

Caution: Inform all crew before the gas-free operation commences. Manage accommodation ventilation to avoid the ingress of vapors. Exercise the greatest care in all operations connected with tank cleaning and gas freeing.

Refer to ISGOTT regarding the various hazards involved. Consider precautions and risk control measures for identified hazards. Follow the relevant procedures described for tank cleaning and purging operations.

The safety precautions detailed in ISGOTT apply to the gas freeing of all cargo, bunker, and ballast tanks.

####### Precautions to Prevent Human Injury

Allow only personnel directly involved in the gas freeing operations on the main deck. Guard the tank openings. Comply with the job/watch schedule.

All crew involved in the gas freeing operations must wear personal gas detectors, appropriate clothing and observe antistatic precautions on deck.

Close all tank openings until actual ventilation of the individual tank is about to start.

If small crafts are alongside the tanker, inform their personnel. Monitor the atmosphere in the operations area for explosive hydrocarbon vapours during such conditions.

###### Atmosphere Control for Tanks & Pipes to be Gas-Free

During gas purging/gas freeing operations, control the tank and pipelines' atmosphere.

Caution: Do not allow the atmosphere to enter the flammable range (of the flammability diagram) at any time. Exercise great vigilance where gas is being vented (purged or gas freed). The highest concentration of gases (hydrocarbon or inert gas) is emitted at the start of such operations. Exercise greater care if venting velocity is low when portable gas-free fans are used. Use only the vessel’s approved method to vent flammable gas during gas freeing. Where gas freeing involves the escape of gas at deck level or through tank hatch openings, control the degree of ventilation and the number of openings to produce an exit velocity sufficient to carry the gas clear of the deck.

Isolate the tank from the IG main line by inserting a blind flange at the IG tank supply valve, once an oil cargo tank with oxygen content at 20.9% has been confirmed free of:

Explosive hydrocarbon vapors (less than 1% HC LEL)

Toxic gases

Contaminants

Reduce IG in adjacent tanks to a minimum (200 mmwq) to prevent the ingress of hydrocarbon gas/IG through any leaking valves, pipelines, or (damaged/cracked) bulkheads.

Close all other valves to the tank (including P/V valves). Clear gas vent riser drains of water, rust, and sediment.

If the tanks are connected by a common venting system, isolate each tank to prevent the transfer of gas to or from other tanks. If petroleum vapors persist on deck in high concentrations, stop gas freeing.

###### Preventing Gas Entering the Accommodation Area

Change course, if necessary, to prevent hydrocarbon vapors from accumulating in the accommodation areas during gas freeing operations.

If sparks or hot soot come from the funnel stacks, stop gas freeing operations. Where gas freeing while the vessel is at anchor, if necessary, suspend operation during periods with calm or no winds (always comply with local regulations regarding port permissions/emissions).

Adjust intakes of central air conditioning or mechanical ventilating systems to prevent the entry of petroleum gas.

If required, use partial recirculation of air within the spaces but maintain positive pressure in the accommodation.

If it is suspected that gas is being drawn into the accommodation, stop central air conditioning and mechanical ventilating systems and close the intakes.

###### Precautions Related to Gas Freeing Equipment and Use of Portable Fans

Use portable fans or blowers only if they are hydraulically, pneumatically, water, or steam-driven.

They should be built of spark-proof material.

Place portable fans in such positions and arrange the ventilation openings so that all parts of the tank being ventilated are equally and effectively gas freed. Keep ventilation outlets (discharged gas) as distant from the fans as possible. Ensure an effective electrical bond between the portable fan and the deck.

Note: Use fixed gas freeing equipment to gas free more than one tank simultaneously. Do not use for this purpose if the system is being used to ventilate another

##### Tank Entry after Gas Freeing

The person entering the tank and the person authorizing entry shall follow this procedure:

Allow about 10 minutes to elapse after stopping ventilation into any tank before taking final gas measurements. This allows relatively stable conditions to develop within the tank space.

Make the tests at several levels and in each compartment of the tank.

Make the tests at widely separate positions in large compartments.

Gas readings should be 20.9%  vol of oxygen, and HC content shall not exceed 1% LEL.

If satisfactory gas readings are not obtained, resume ventilation.

Complete form HSEQ 09 - Enclosed Space Entry Permit.

Responsible person, accompanied by another crewmember, shall first enter the tank and verify the atmosphere throughout the tank bottom

Caution: they shall wear personal gas detectors and EEBDs

Personnel entering the tank should always use personal gas meters.

Before entry, evaluate and decide on countermeasures for vapor buildup due to disturbing sludge at the bottom and due to man entry footsteps.

Record gas freeing operations in the bridge logbook.

Record gas inerting records during gas freeing operations using form TANK 21.

Signals Indicating a Problem with Air Supply in a Confined Space:

Personal gas detector alarm is activated

Shallow rapid breathing

Vision blurred, spots in front of eyes, vision blackouts

Exaggerated sense of feeling good

Disorientation

Profuse sweating

Ringing in the ears

Smell of solvents, gases, vapours, etc.

Slippery sweet taste on the lips

Dryness of the throat

Chest pains

Change in heart rate

Sudden skin irritation

Loss of manual dexterity

Loss of coordination

Weakness in the knees

Caution: Exit the area immediately if any of the above signals becomes apparent!

Note: the attendant should also monitor the behavior of the person entering the tank to determine if these signals are evident and immediately retract the entrant if the entrant does not exit on his/her own.

##### Mopping of Cargo Tanks

After tank cleaning, it is often required to remove the remaining residues and dry the tanks to prepare for the next cargo.

Complete form HSEQ-09 Enclosed Space Entry Permit.

Perform a risk assessment taking into account all hazards involved and related mitigating measures.

Conduct a toolbox meeting and discuss various aspects of the mopping operation.

Follow precautions for entry after gas freeing, given later in this section.

Exercise care if stagnant pools of liquid are observed.

Note: They may contain toxic liquid and emit gas.

Mopping requires a cleaning team to enter the tank and complete the process manually.

###### Guidance for Mopping of Cargo Tanks

Chief Officer shall do below:

Conduct a risk assessment and a toolbox talk with all crew involved to ensure hazards are identified and personnel are aware of preventive measures and actions to implement.

On the apparent completion of gas freeing of any tank, interrupt ventilation for about 10 minutes before taking final gas measurements.

Note: This allows relatively stable conditions to develop within the tank space.

Test the atmosphere at several levels and in each compartment of the tank. In large compartments, make tests at widely separate positions.

Note: If satisfactory gas readings are not obtained, resume ventilation.

When the atmosphere is determined safe for entry, follow the enclosed space entry procedure. Issue a permit for entry.

Note: Personnel involved must sign the permit.

Resume ventilation of the space and maintain it until the job is completed and the cleaning team vacates the space.

Place placards showing precaution notices near the valves or their controls and pumps connected to the tank where the work is in progress to avoid any accidental operation.

Personnel entering the tank must use appropriate PPE and personal gas meters. They must understand the meaning of alarms and actions to take if an alarm is activated.

Keep the number of persons entering the tank minimal for a quick rescue operation in case of any emergency.

Take all necessary equipment and tools required for work such as rags, buckets, scoops, water, etc.

Warn crew members about the possibility of vapor buildup due to footsteps disturbing the sludge at the bottom and countermeasures for the same, to be evaluated and decided during the toolbox talk.

During work, monitor and regularly record the tank’s atmosphere.

Stop the work if the time limit mentioned on the work permit expires. Issue a new permit to work if necessary.

Clean the space, dispose of the residues and used materials in accordance with MARPOL regulations.



### 8.1.8 Ballast Water Management - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Ballast Water Management Control

###### Introduction

This procedure guides the handling of ballast water to control water pollution from shipboard operations and reduce the environmental impacts associated with ballast water discharges.

It applies to all operations and activities on board vessels generating wastewater discharged to the sea.

- MARPOL 73/78 requires that all vessels carry a ballast water management plan.

- The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has issued guidelines for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water to Minimize the Transfer of Harmful Aquatic Organisms and Pathogens, recognizing the potential for uncontrolled ballast water discharge to cause harm.

- Several states require vessels to comply with quarantine requirements for ballast management.

- The carriage and disposal of ballast water can significantly contribute to the transfer of species of aquatic organisms and water-borne pathogens from their natural habitats. Vessels must comply with mandatory schemes concerning the handling of ballast water, as per the procedures detailed in the Ballast Water Management Plan.

- The Ballast Water Management Plan minimizes the risk of transplanting harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens from ships' ballast water and associated sediments while maintaining ship safety.

- Studies in several countries have shown that many species of bacteria, plants, and animals can survive in ballast water and sediment, even after journeys of several weeks.

- The subsequent discharge of ballast water or sediment into port waters may establish colonies of harmful species and pathogens, seriously upsetting the existing ecological balance.

- Organisms are transferred between geographically separated sea areas due to ballast water discharge from ships.

###### Responsibilities

Master: Comply with national Ballast Water Management requirements.

Chief Officer: Designated officer in charge of implementing the vessel’s Ballast Water Management Plan.

Chief Engineer: Maintain the vessel’s ballast equipment, such as Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS), pumps, valves, pipelines, and drain cocks, in good and usable condition.

###### Definitions

Regulation D-1 Ballast Water Exchange Standard

- Ships performing ballast water exchange in accordance with this regulation must achieve at least 95 percent volumetric exchange of ballast water.

Regulation D-2 Ballast Water Performance Standard

- Ships conducting ballast water management in accordance with this regulation must limit the discharge of viable organisms, including specified indicator microbes harmful to human health.

Note: D-2 regulations are met by using a Ballast Water Treatment Plant unit.

##### Ballast Water Management

Vessels must follow Regulation D-2.

###### Regulation D-2 - use of Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS)

The use of the Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS) is the mandatory option.

It is part of the Ballast Water Management Plan and must be used in strict compliance with the operation manual.

If local regulations do not accept the treatment of ballast water using the BWTS, then a ballast water exchange must take place as described in the approved Ballast Water Management Plan.

Note: The ballast exchange must be conducted using the BWTS.

###### Ballast Water Treatment

The requirement for ballast water treatment arises from the requirements of regulation D-2 of the International Convention for the Control of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM Convention).

Fig 1 - Generic ballast water treatment technology process options

Ballast Water Treatment Technology

There are two generic types of process technology used in ballast water treatment:

- Solid-liquid separation

- Disinfection

Solid-liquid separation involves the removal of suspended solid material, including larger suspended micro-organisms, from the ballast water through sedimentation (allowing solids to settle out by their own weight) or surface filtration (removal by straining).

Disinfection removes or inactivates micro-organisms using one or more of the following methods:

- Chemical inactivation of micro-organisms.

- Physicochemical inactivation by ultraviolet light irradiation, which denatures the DNA of micro-organisms, preventing them from reproducing. Ultrasound or cavitation (termed 'micro-agitation') are also physico-chemical disinfection methods.

- Deoxygenation by displacing dissolved oxygen with inert gas injection or stripping it by means of a vacuum, thereby asphyxiating the micro-organism.

Most commercial systems employ two stages of treatment: a solid-liquid separation stage followed by disinfection, though some disinfection technologies are used in isolation. One ballast water treatment technology employs chemical enhancement (e.g., coagulation/flocculation) upstream of solid-liquid separation; another employs titanium dioxide (TiO2) to intensify ultraviolet irradiation.

- Use ballast water treatment plants as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

- Maintain them as per PMS.

The contents of surviving aquatic organisms in ballast water discharged from vessels requiring treatment as per the Convention shall meet the following requirements:

- Fewer than 10 living aquatic organisms greater than or equal to 50 microns per cubic meter of water.

- Fewer than 10 living aquatic organisms less than 50 microns but larger than or equal to 10 microns per millilitre of water.

- Vibrio cholera is fewer than one colony-forming unit per 100 ml; Escherichia coli is fewer than 250 colony-forming units per 100 ml; Enterococcus is fewer than 100 colony-forming units per 100 ml.

###### Ballast Water Sampling Points

- Samples shall be drawn:

- at the request and under the supervision of a port state or quarantine officer.

- for required periodic analyses in the presence of the laboratory representative

- Crew shall be familiar with use of BWTS sampling points and the sampling procedure

- The time required to analyse the samples shall not be used as a basis to unduly delay the operations or departure of the ship.

###### Hazards and Safety Measures

Manufacturer’s instructions must be always followed when operating the BWTS. There are various types of BWTS:

- Systems that produce disinfectant on board by electrolysis and inject it into the ballast water.

- Systems where the disinfectant is prepared on board and injected into the ballast water.

- Systems that use UV light to disinfect the ballast water.

Note: Some systems may use back-flush filters to retain or dispose of larger bio-organisms.

Authorized personnel should be familiar with the operation, inspection, and maintenance of the BWTS, particularly the hazards associated with operating the equipment and handling and storing any chemicals used. Where applicable, a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) should be provided, describing the proper storage and handling procedures for the chemicals.

Caution: Do not store wet chlorine in closed and unventilated areas, as wet chemicals containing chlorine may self-react and produce heat and emit toxic and corrosive fumes.

The quantity of disinfectant needed is automatically regulated by the BWTS. The system should not exceed the maximum chemical dosage and the maximum allowable discharge concentration of TRO at any time. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling chemicals, referring to the MSDS for guidance.

BWTS using electrolysis units to produce disinfectant may emit hydrogen (H₂).

Caution: H₂ is highly flammable. Ensure that the space where the electrolysis units are installed is well-ventilated and that the H₂ sensor is in good operational order and tested regularly.

##### Contingency Measures in Case of BWTS Failure

As the vessel's primary ballast water management method is treatment upon intake and discharge, a failure of the Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS) leads to non-compliance with the vessel's certification.

From the point of certification, there is no difference regarding when or where the BWTS fails; technical failure of the BWTS automatically means loss of compliance.

Therefore, all technical failures of the BWTS must be reported to the Technical Superintendent (TSI)/Operations, detailing the following:

- Malfunctions of the BWTS.

- Ports with challenging water quality (CWQ)

From an environmental and operational perspective, the timing and location of the BWTS failure are crucial, as short-term substitute procedures must be defined on a case-by-case basis. Close cooperation between the vessel, TSI, Operations, affected port states, flag state, and classification society is required.

The Master must inform the Flag State and the authorities in the port of destination (through the Agent) and get advice on the actions to implement.

The involved parties should consider the following non-exclusive list of possible contingency measures, depending on the actual situation and practical feasibility:

- Retention of ballast water on board: Completely avoid ballast water discharge in port by shifting ballast internally.

- Internal circulation after BWTS repair: If BWTS failure occurred during ballast intake and the tanks contain partly untreated water that needs to be discharged in the next port, repair the BWTS and perform internal circulation of the non-compliant water through the repaired BWTS before executing standard discharge operations.

- Fallback on D1 standard: Execute ballast water exchange according to the BWMC and as described in the BWMP.

- Discharge of non-compliant ballast water: Transfer ballast water to another vessel, barge, or shore-based reception facility.

Record all actions in the Ballast Water Record Book and create a Defect Report in the PMS Software.

###### In case of BWTS failure

In case of BWTS failure, the master shall:

- Inform Office and Flag State (via Office)

- Inform the Port State authorities in the arrival port

- Obtain advice regarding alternative ballast water management practice accepted by the authorities in the arrival port and the Flag State

- If D-1 treatment method is accepted prepare a Risk Assessment, a Ballast Water Exchange Plan as per vessels BWMP, and submit to Office for approval

- Consider ballasting the minimum SOLAS safe quantity required for the sea passage

- Keep a full and accurate log of ballast operations and make records available to port state authorities.

Note: Pre-planning is essential to maintain safety where compliance with ballast exchange or other ballast water treatment or control options is required.

Consider safety information when preparing the voyage plan. Report in advance to the national monitoring authority the amount of ballast water on board upon arrival, where it was taken, and whether a ballast management procedure has been followed (i.e., Exchange or Treatment).

####### BWTS Failure due to CWQ

In Ports with challenging water quality (CWQ) the vessel shall, before considering bypassing the system, carry out trouble shooting and identify mitigating measures that could assist in continuing the operation using the BWTS, such as:

- Ensure that the restrictions are originating from the water quality and not from other sources (i.e. maintenance, malfunctions, familiarization with system operation)

- Conduct the operation at minimum operational requirements (flow rates)

- Manually operate any back-flushing controls, if possible

- Apply suitable back-pressure at high differential filter pressures

- Maximize UV intensity, where applicable

- Load, if possible, minimum safe ballast quantity via the BWTS and complete the ballasting in less challenging waters immediately after departure from port

If bypassing the BWTS system is unavoidable in CWQ, then:

- Inform Office and Flag State (via Office)

- Consider limiting the number of ballast tanks that will be loaded with untreated ballast water

- After departure, in less challenging water quality, complete the ballasting using the BWTS

- Before arrival in the next port decontaminate the affected tanks

- Obtain further advice on other measures to be taken from the Port State Authorities in the next arrival port (as per BWMC Regulation B - 4.2)

###### Decontamination of the ballast tanks

Decontamination of the ballast tanks in the aftermath of BWTS bypassing is required to bring the vessel back to compliance with D2 standard condition.

####### Guidance

BWMC Convention requires Regulation B-4 - Ballast Water Exchange, requires:

- A ship conducting Ballast Water exchange to meet the standard in regulation D-1 shall:

    - .1 whenever possible, conduct such Ballast Water exchange at least 200 nautical miles from the nearest land and in water at least 200 metres in depth, taking into account the Guidelines developed by the Organization;

    - .2 in cases where the ship is unable to conduct Ballast Water exchange in accordance with paragraph 1.1, such Ballast Water exchange shall be conducted taking into account the Guidelines described in paragraph 1.1 and as far from the nearest land as possible, and in all cases at least 50 nautical miles from the nearest land and in water at least 200 metres in depth.

- In sea areas where the distance from the nearest land or the depth does not meet the parameters described in paragraph 1.1 or 1.2, the port State may designate areas, in consultation with adjacent or other States, as appropriate, where a ship may conduct Ballast Water exchange, taking into account the Guidelines described in paragraph 1.1.

####### Decontamination process

Replace the ballast water in each contaminated tank through ballast water exchange, flushing and treatment.

Do the following:

- Fully discharge the ballast water from contaminated tank through the treatment process

- Strip the tank(s) to remove the residual water

- Flush the contaminated tank(s) by following below steps:

- Add treated water to ballast tank (minimum amount of water should cover the entire bottom of the tank

- Mix the water through the motion of the ship

- Release the mixed waters

- Refill with treated ballast water

###### Recordkeeping

In the instances when the BWTS has not operated as expected owing to CWQ the following shall be recorded in the Ballast Water Record Book:

- the reason why normal ballasting operations were stopped;

- any steps taken to optimize the treatment process and resolve BWMS technical malfunctions;

- the operational demands that were not met and/or operational limitations encountered;

- the steps that were taken prior to a bypass being initiated (as relevant);

- the tanks which have received bypassed ballast water (tank ID);

- the date, time and location where the bypass took place; and

- the decontamination steps that were taken to recover from BWMS bypass as per the approved BWMP, including:

- the start and end locations (GPS coordinates) at which any flushing and/or exchange took place

- the start date and time

- end date and time

- the method of exchange and the volume exchanged and/or flushed.

##### Precautions for Ballast Exchange at Sea (BWTS Failure)

In principle, there are only two methods for exchanging ballast water at sea:

- Sequential Method: The ballast tanks are pumped out and then refilled following a pre-defined safe sequence.

- Flow-Through Method: Overflowing ballast tanks following a pre-defined sequence to dilute the water in the tanks.

Exchange water using the method described in vessel’s Ballast Water Management Plan.

###### Sequential Method

- The process requires the removal and replacement of very large weights from the ship in a dynamic situation.

- The Ballast Water Exchange Plan indicates the status of the ballast water in every tank at the start of each step and includes the assumed weight of fuel and domestic drinking water (Aft of the Engine Room Bulkhead), estimated draughts, bending moments, and shear forces. The actions to take and tanks involved in each step are specified.

- The original condition is restored after each pair of steps.

- Make a positive decision before proceeding to the next pair of steps, considering the ship’s position, weather forecast, machinery performance, and degree of crew fatigue. If any factors are unfavorable, suspend or halt the ballast exchange.

- Heeling effects due to asymmetrical emptying or filling have been considered so that all steps represent upright conditions. Manage actual operations to prevent developing lists during pumping.

- The steps meet trim and draught requirements for propeller and rudder immersion, to avoid slamming while changing ballast, and to maintain bridge visibility within tolerable limits.

- Avoid under pressure in a tank due to emptying, and overpressure when filling.

Note: The consequences of bulkhead damage, or even tank collapse, at sea are more significant than in port.

- Check each step for conformity with strength and stress limitations. Ensure that the minimum intact stability requirements of the ship are met at every stage and that the allowable limits for bending and twisting moments are not exceeded.

- The figure given under bending moments is the percentage of the maximum allowable at the end of each step, before commencing the next step. Some vessels are provided with guidance regarding Sea Going Bending Moments (SGBM) – if provided, this factor is to be used. Still Water Bending Moments (SWBM) are generally available on larger vessels for use in port calculations and thus are of limited value when underway.

###### Flow-Through Method

- The flow-through method, whereby tanks are overfilled by pumping in additional water, can be used in weather conditions marginal for the sequential method, as there is little change to the ship's condition.

- Consider other risks and problems when using the flow-through method.

- Research has established that it is necessary to pump in three times the volume of the tank to achieve a 95% change of water. Pumping in only once the volume of the tank produces a 63% exchange; twice the volume produces an 86% exchange, while four times the volume produces a 98% water exchange.

Note: The ship's design parameters consider storm conditions and resulting water on deck. Therefore, even at maximum pumping rates, any accumulation of water on deck will not affect stability.

- After each step, consider the ship’s position, weather forecast, machinery performance, and degree of crew fatigue. If any factors are unfavourable, suspend or halt the ballast exchange.

##### Sediment Removal or Reduction

Ballast tanks sediments shall be managed in accordance with ship’s Ballast Water Management Plan.

- Where practical, clean the ballast tanks to remove sediments as per the plan agreed with the Technical Superintendent or when the Master considers it necessary.

Note: Flushing helps minimize the amount of mud and debris remaining in a tank but is not effective for removing bacteria, plant, and animal organisms.

- Establish a routine for manual cleaning of ballast tanks on a sequential basis to reduce the build-up of sediment.

- Clean tanks when the vessel moves from one trading area to another, if necessary

- Record all actions associated with sediment removal, whether flushing operations or manual removal of sediment build-up, in the Ballast Water Record Book – code G.

To assist in minimizing the risk of transporting and/or discharging unwanted harmful organisms and pathogens:

- Thoroughly rinse anchors and anchor chains when weighing anchor to remove all organisms and sediments at their place of origin.

- Clean chain lockers regularly during sea passages to avoid accumulations of mud and sediment. Keep any mud onboard to be properly disposed of either in mid-ocean or to shore reception facilities.

- Remove fouling organisms from the hull, piping, and tanks regularly and dispose of removed matter in accordance with local, national, and international regulations.

##### Ballast Reporting Form

- The IMO has developed a form for reporting to a national authority that requests information in advance.

- Some countries require using their own form when reporting.

- Pre-format the reporting forms to contain permanent information such as the ship’s name, IMO number, total number of tanks onboard, total ballast capacity, etc.

###### Specific Reporting Requirements

Several countries, ports, and regions have identified procedures / reporting requirements specific to their needs. While these generally follow similar processes, it is essential that the Master and Chief Officer are aware of the requirements for each port and instruct the other officers accordingly.

Special care and reporting procedures may be required in places like California, the Persian Gulf, the Baltic, the Black Sea, China, etc. Known requirements are identified in the ship’s ballast management plan and should be used as briefing notes for specific trading areas.

##### Crew Training & Familiarization

Train all crew involved in the management of ballast water and operation of the BWTS in accordance with the Ballast Water Management Plan requirements.

Maintenance of BWTS

Vessels equipped with an approved BWTS must use it for any ballasting operations unless other local requirements at the next port of destination prevail.

Procedures described in the Ballast Water Management Plan and the BWTS operation booklet must be strictly followed.

BWTS must be strictly maintained and tested according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the company’s Planned Maintenance System (PMS).

Conduct a Risk Assessment (RA) and implement required mitigating measures before any maintenance.

Quality tests of a sample of discharged ballast water must be conducted in accordance with International Maritime Organization (IMO) and Vessel General Permit (VGP) requirements.



### 8.1.9 STS, SPM, CBM Operations - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Operations at SPM/SBM

###### Introduction

####### Monitoring the Load on SBM

Load on SBM mooring system can be monitored using one or more methods, as applicable:

- Visual observation

- Systems with load pins in the connector plate/joints

- Audible and visual alarms on the buoy

- Alarm status displayed remotely via telemetry

###### Guidance on Ballasting / De-Ballasting at SPM / SBM

Key Points:

- Take ballast to meet terminal requirements, considering cargo hose length restrictions.

- Do not exceed the maximum safe draught at the berth.

- Calculate ship’s stresses (sea condition) to avoid extreme shear forces or bending moments.

- Assess the risk of cargo solidification due to cold ballast water.

If Risk of Cargo Solidification:

- Ballast tanks only up to a level where ballast water does not get in contact with the cargo tank bottom until the cargo tank is fully empty.

- Ensure and verify safe loading, discharging, ballasting, and de-ballasting parameters.

##### Terminal line flushing at SBM/SPM

Some terminals require vessels to flush shorelines with water after discharging.

This should be discussed with and approved by the office, with all necessary documentation released by charterers. If agreed:

- Ensure discharging is complete.

- Confirm all cargo is discharged from tanks and cargo lines.

- Connect spool piece between cargo and ballast system after stripping, cargo lines, and pumps are drained.

- Calculate trim, stability, and strength limits during the operation.

- If vessel design permits, supply flushing water from segregated ballast tanks.

- If using a sea connection, follow these precautions:

- Set the line using the cargo pump from sea to cargo line, keeping the outboard sea valve closed.

- Drain oil from the pump room cargo system.

- Start the pump at reduced revolutions.

- Prime the line using AUS or stripping pump if needed.

- Ensure sufficient vacuum is created between the pump and the sea valve.

- Open the sea valve slowly and increase pump speed gradually.

- Monitor the sea area around the pump room for oil spills.

Follow below steps on completion of flushing operation:

- Collect residues in a slop tank.

- Remove the spool piece.

- Issue the required Letters of Protest.

##### Cargo Operations at CBM

Conventional buoy mooring (CBM) systems restrict tankers from weather-vanning and are used for smaller tankers in moderate or directional conditions with limited loading/offloading frequency.

CBM System Features:

- Multiple buoys fixed to the seabed with mooring lines and anchors.

- Three to six buoys in a rectangular pattern for safe mooring.

- Use normal mooring ropes and possibly both anchors.

Operational Guidelines:

- Follow pre-arrival precautions, checklists, and procedures for cargo operations similar to terminal operations.

- Maintain bridge watch only if agreed with the terminal.

- Establish efficient communication between ship and shore.

- Calculate stress and stability for sea conditions, as CBM systems may be in unprotected areas.

##### Ship to Ship Transfer Operation

Refer to guidance provided in ship’s specific STS manual.

STS operations should be carried out under the advisory control of one individual, called POAC.

Safety Precautions:

- Both tankers must comply with normal cargo operation safety precautions.

- Do not start or continue operations if safety precautions are not observed.

- Maintain safe mooring conditions by equalizing tension of lines on both vessels and in same direction

Operational Limits:

Consider suspending STS operation and separating with other vessel if:

- Visibility less than one mile

- Winds greater than 25 knots

Personnel Transfer During STS:

- Carry out risk assessment for personnel transfer operation

- Obtain permission from the POAC.

- Follow guidance provided in Chapter 5.3.11 – Personnel transfer

- Use the HSEQ 25 – Personnel Transfer Permit.

Bridge Watch:

- Manned by the Master and navigating officers during STS.

- Use mooring masters, pilots, or POAC as advisors, not for watchkeeping duties.

- Request additional OOW from Office if rest hour regulations cannot be met.

- Refer to the latest Ship to Ship Transfer Guide and specific STS Manual for further guidance.

###### Vapor Balancing During STS operations

Vapor balancing is a method used to transfer cargo vapors between ships to avoid releasing gases into the atmosphere. It involves connecting a vapor return line between the discharging and receiving vessels.

To ensure that vapour balancing operation is done safely and cargo vapors are not accidentally released into atmosphere, the following recommendations shall be followed:

Before cargo transfer:

- Use appropriate equipment to monitor the vapour stream.

- The oxygen analyzer and alarms should be tested for proper function before each cargo transfer operation. Where local regulations require, the vapour stream should be monitored continuously, with audible and visual alarms, to ensure that the oxygen does not exceed 8% by volume.

- Before cargo transfer the vapour space of the discharging facility and receiving tank should be inerted to less than 8% oxygen.

- The VRL pressure alarm setting should be lower than 80% of the P/V valve lowest release setting.

- If it is safe, the vapour transfer hose should be purged and inerted before the vapour transfer.

- Do not open the vapour manifold valves until the IG pressure of the receiving ship exceeds that of the discharging ship.

Note: Complete checklist TANK 11B – STS transfer vapor balancing checklist before commencement of operation.

During the cargo transfer:

- The IG system on the discharging ship should be operational and on standby with the IG main deck isolating valve closed. Use the IG system if the IG pressure in the discharging ship falls below 300mm WG.

- The IG pressure in cargo tanks should be monitored and the information regularly exchanged between the two ships.

- Do not let air enter the cargo tanks.

- Stop the transfer if the oxygen content of the vapour stream is above 8% by volume. It is only safe to continue the transfer once the oxygen content is 8% or less by volume.

- The cargo transfer rate should not exceed the designed rate for the vapour balancing hose.

##### Simultaneous Lightering Operations (Double-Banking)

Simultaneous lightering operations refers to cargo transfers using both port and starboard manifolds. The decision is made on case-by-case and shall involve consultation with the operations department.

Decision Factors:

- Compliance with OCIMF recommendations, Company’s SIMOPS procedures and ISGOTT guidelines.

- Suitability of equipment such as fenders, rigging, and hoses.

- Adequate communication equipment and systems.

- Workload and crew fatigue considerations.

- Possible need for additional watchkeeping officers.

- Separate systems for lightering vessels where possible.

- Conduct topping-off operations on one lightering vessel at a time.

- Avoid COW operations during double-banking.

- Ensure the ability to launch at least one lifeboat.

- Use personnel transfer baskets following manufacturer’s guidelines for testing and maintenance.

### 8.2.2 Chemical Tanker Operations - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Chemical Tanker Operations

###### Introduction

Follow below guidelines, as applicable:

IMS Chapter 8.1.1

Vessel’s P&A manual

International Bulk Chemical Code (IBC Code)

As per IMO and IBC Code, chemical cargoes are divided into two main categories:

Chapter 17 products, for which the code is applicable

Chapter 18 products, for which the IBC code is not applicable

This categorization is based on the individual properties of each chemical grade in terms of pollution and safety.

Each ship is provided with a ship-specific PROCEDURES & ARRANGEMENTS MANUAL (P&A Manual) describing all the physical arrangements and operational procedures related to the ship's cargo operations as per the requirements of MARPOL ANNEX II.

Follow the instructions and procedures contained in the P&A Manual for any of the following procedures:

Cargo Loading

Cargo discharging

Cargo tank stripping

Draining of cargo pumps, cargo, and stripping lines

Cargo tank prewash systems

Cargo tank ballasting and deballasting

Discharge of residue/water mixtures

Procedures to follow when cargo tank cannot be discharged as per the required procedure

###### Preparing Vessel for Loading

Before arriving at each loading port, to prepare the loading plan, the master should be aware of the hazards of the concerned cargo such as:

Fire

Health

Pollution

Stowage

Quantity to be loaded

Refer to the International Bulk Chemical (IBC) Code for dangerous chemical cargoes and the approved loading manual for information regarding the hazards of the cargo.

The Fitness Certificate states the type of cargo the vessel can carry.

Plan stowage of the cargo based on the following information:

Information from data sheets included in the operation manual of the vessel

Permitted tanks to be loaded

The tanks coating resistance

Trim and stability information booklet

Clean the tanks for loading, considering the previous cargo onboard and the intended cargo to be loaded. Tanks should be clean and suitable for loading prior to arrival at the loading port.

Charterers generally advise cleaning standards for the intended cargo. However, refer to tank cleaning manuals and software on board, which contain safe procedures for cleaning tanks as well as chemicals to use for cleaning and details of data sheets concerning hazards.

Cleaning of tanks generally follows this sequence:

Prewashing (either with fresh water or seawater depending on manual instructions)

Washing with fresh or salt water with added chemical cleaning agents as per the cleaning manual's instructions

Rinsing with fresh or salt water

Rinsing with fresh water or steam, followed by drying

During tank cleaning, consider the health and pollution hazards of the chemical cleaning agents and atmospheric conditions of the tanks, considering fire hazards.

Check the atmosphere frequently. Take precautions such as:

Wearing safety clothing

Using equipment to protect from specific cargo health hazards

Taking necessary measures against fire and pollution hazards

Continue with necessary precautions until the vessel's tanks and atmosphere around decks and void spaces are free of the above hazards.

Permit entry into enclosed spaces or tanks/pump rooms/void spaces during the above operations only in accordance with the Enclosed Space Entry procedure.

####### Stowage of Chemical Products

Plan stowage of chemical cargoes after considering:

Cargo characteristics and data sheet

Rules and regulations (IBC, USCG compatibility rules, etc.)

Vessel's certificate of fitness

Vessel's P&A Manual

Tank coating compatibility

Tank coating condition

Applicable cleaning methods and procedures

Necessary information of the cargo and the stowage plan should be available on board. Such information should include, for each chemical carried:

A full description of the physical and chemical properties, including reactivity, necessary for the safe containment of the cargo

Actions to take in the event of spills or leaks

Countermeasures against accidental personal contact

Firefighting procedures and firefighting media

Procedures for cargo transfer, tank cleaning, gas freeing, and ballasting

Caution: Refuse to carry the cargo if:

The cargo requires stabilization or inhibition as per the IBC Code, and the appropriate certificate required by the IBC Code is not supplied

Sufficient information for the safe transportation of the cargo is not available

The master shall ensure that prior to any loading operation, the above requirements, as well as the other operational requirements detailed in Chapter 5 of the IBC Code, can be safely met.

Prior to the loading operation, the master shall submit the stowage plan to the office, together with a List of Product Data, which shall contain the following information:

Note: (*) Commercial names   are not   acceptable, i.e., it must be possible to identify the product in the Certificate of Fitness and the tank coating resistance manual.

Carry out cleaning procedure as per the P&A Manual with relevant flow chart number

If one or more data is not available, the master shall not proceed with the loading operation. He should contact the office for further instructions.

###### Cargo Loading

Consult the P&A Manual of the vessel for cargo details and hazards.

Check the vessel’s operation manual compatibility charts for the compatibility between the cargoes and their handling.

Clean tanks properly to avoid loaded cargoes reacting with other cargoes or water.

If such cargoes are loaded at the same port, stow them in separate tanks with void spaces in between, formed by separated double bulkheads.

Separate the tanks, vents, and lines for reactive cargo from other edible cargoes, especially if the cargoes are toxic or corrosive.

Do not stow cargo with single bulkhead separation if one of the cargoes requires heating during passage, which may affect the nearby cargo and cause reactions or other hazards like toxic fumes, explosions, or polymerization.

Ensure washings of incompatible cargoes do not mix in the same tanks or lines to avoid reactions and hazards. In such cases, washings should be stowed in separate tanks using separate lines. Comply with MARPOL regulations regarding the disposal of slops and follow the procedures as per the P&A manual of the vessel.

Make full use of the vapor return line, if available, when carrying dangerous cargoes containing toxic substances to reduce vapor hazards.

If carrying flammable cargoes, inert the cargo spaces when applicable.

Caution: Chemical tankers carrying Marpol Annex I (Oil and Oil Products) cargo shall comply with all IMS procedures contained in Chapter 8.1. – Oil.

####### Organization and Duties During Loading

Follow all instructions given in IMS Chapter 8.1.2 - Loading Operations.

###### Discharging

Follow all instructions given in IMS Chapter 8.1.4 - Discharge Operations.

###### Laden Passage

Follow all instructions given in IMS Chapter 8.1.3 – Laden Passage.

Chemical tankers carry cargoes with widely different characteristics, requiring special care during the voyage.

Ensure the inert gas capacity is sufficient for the entire voyage. If using stored nitrogen, confirm there is sufficient nitrogen on board prior to sailing to comply with the inerting requirements.

Monitor cargoes that may self-react daily to detect any abnormal behaviour early. Unexpected temperature changes are an important early indicator of a possible self-reaction. Ensure no part of the cargo overheats.

Crystallization of inhibited liquid cargoes can lead to depletion of the inhibitor in parts of the tank contents. Subsequent melting of the crystals can yield pockets of uninhibited liquid, risking dangerous self-polymerization.

For inhibited cargoes, carefully observe:

Precautions and limitations described in the inhibitor certificate

Control of the tank atmosphere

Overpressure

Most inhibitors are not volatile, so they do not vaporize with the cargo vapors. Regularly inspect inside vent valves and flame arresters and clear any blockages by solid polymers.

##### Inerting of Cargo Tanks

Definitions:

Inerting: Displacement of air from a previously clean and gas-free tank to create an inert atmosphere, ensuring the tank atmosphere cannot support combustion by reducing the oxygen content. Inerting with nitrogen also reduces the moisture content of the tank atmosphere for cargo compatibility and quality control reasons.

Padding: Filling and maintaining the cargo tank and associated piping system with an inert gas, or other gas, vapor, or liquid, to separate the cargo from air.

Purging: Introduction of inert gas into an already inert tank to further reduce the oxygen content and/or reduce the existing hydrocarbon or other flammable vapor content to a level where combustion cannot be supported if air is subsequently introduced.

Guidance:

Load flammable cargo in cargo tanks under an inert atmosphere. Maintain the inerted condition of cargo tanks during loading, transit, and discharging. Follow procedures and guidance given in IMS Chapter 8.1.5 – Inert Gas Management.

In some cases, inerting is not appropriate for safety reasons because the sensitivity of the cargo to inert gas or exclusion of oxygen could create hazardous situations.

For example, chemicals like acrylic acid, styrene, and vinyl acetate have added inhibitors to prevent polymerization during transportation. These inhibitors require oxygen presence in the ullage space to be effective.

Carry inhibited monomers in tanks with an oxygen level sufficient for the inhibitor to function.

Conduct a risk assessment to identify hazards associated with carrying a flammable cargo in an explosive atmosphere and implement measures to minimize risks. Instructions and procedures for this aspect are provided in Chapter 8.2.7 – Precautions Against Electrostatic Hazards.

##### Pre-Cleaning of Cargo Tanks

Certain cargoes require tanks to be pre-cleaned before the main tank cleaning process to prepare for the next cargo.

Examples requiring pre-cleaning include:

Polymerizing Cargo (e.g., Styrene Monomer): These cargoes are carried with inhibitors for stabilizing during carriage. If not cleaned immediately after discharge, remnants may polymerize. Immediately after discharge and issuing an “empty tank” certificate, carry out a pre-clean with one cycle of the tank cleaning machines using cold water. Flush vents and pipelines/valves with water if possible. Leave the slops at the bottom of the tank for later cleaning.

Drying Oils (e.g., Soybean Oil): If not pre-cleaned immediately, remnants may oxidize, forming a tough film on the surface. Immediately after discharge and issuing an “empty tank” certificate, pre-clean with one cycle of the tank cleaning machines. Flush vents and pipelines/valves with water if possible. Leave the slops at the bottom of the tank for later cleaning.

Water-Miscible Cargoes: Fully water-soluble cargoes are easier to clean, and heating the water may reduce cleaning time.

Water-Reactive Cargoes (e.g., Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate/TDI): If exposed to water or humidity, these cargoes leave tough residues. Pre-clean using chemicals (e.g., methylene chloride) that dissolve the residues. Use a nitrogen blanket and discharge the pre-wash ashore. Agree on the pre-cleaning requirements with the charterer, as it may require shore-supplied solvents, additional time, and suitable shore reception for disposal of pre-cleaned slops.

Other cargoes may also require pre-cleaning. Seek necessary guidance and instructions from the charterer or company. Safety of life, the vessel, and the environment takes priority over any commercial demands.

Special Note on Sulfuric Acid: Sulfuric acid reacts with water, giving off heat. As the concentration reduces from its normal carriage concentration of >98%, it becomes more corrosive, even affecting stainless steel. When starting tank cleaning operations, use large quantities of water to dilute the acid quickly and pump it out simultaneously to avoid reaching a pH of seven. Use additional tank cleaning machines and do not allow diluted acid to accumulate in any part of the cargo system.

##### Gas-Freeing

General guidelines for gas freeing of all tankers are covered in IMS Chapter 8.1.7 – Tank Cleaning

See specific guidelines for toxic cargoes below.

Refer to the procedures and operation manuals, as well as other vessel manuals, concerning equipment to use.

During gas-freeing operations, ensure that the exhausted fumes from the tanks are not sprayed over the deck or into accommodation spaces.

Make regular checks of the atmosphere concentration to take timely action. If necessary, stop the operation to avoid health hazards.

During gas-freeing and tank washing operations, and until all fire, health, and pollution hazards have been eliminated, use a closed cycle of operations and discharge fumes only through venting line posts (highest point).

During gas-freeing operations, especially when toxic or flammable cargoes are present, close all accommodation doors and openings and keep air conditioning system air dampers in re-circulation mode (internal suction).

Pay attention to the direction of the wind, and check atmosphere concentration. During gas-freeing operations, all crew on deck should wear protective clothing as per the type of cargo hazards. Use the vapor return line whenever possible. Discharge toxic, dangerous cargoes to terminal facilities using the vapor return line.

##### Venting After Aggressive Cargoes

Cargoes having a vapor pressure greater than 5 kPa at 20°C can be cleaned by ventilation only.

This can have a bearing on commercial operations, as such cargoes do not require extensive cleaning after discharge, and there are no MARPOL regulations governing the discharge of water from a tank cleaned by ventilation.

The procedures for tank cleaning by ventilation are described in detail in the ship-specific Procedures and Arrangements Manual Appendix C.

Venting of toxic cargoes requires special precaution, such as:

Controlling the ventilation

Alteration of the ship's course

Use of suitable personal protective equipment

Epoxy paint coatings absorb solvents, making the coating soft. The problems are damage to the tank coating and contamination of the next cargo.

To return the coating to its original condition, the cargo vapor must be released from the coating by ventilation. The release is faster if the steel temperature is high, achieved by heating the adjacent compartment.

The tank may be heated by keeping the steam heating coils slightly open. The ventilation for releasing the cargo vapor from the coating must be devoid of moisture.

When the dry air contacts the cargo vapor in the coating, the cargo vapor gets absorbed by the air and carried away. The ventilation flow must reach the bottom of the tank, and the exit must be from the tank top at the other end of the tank.

For many cargoes, ventilation is the only acceptable means of removing the last traces from epoxy-coated tanks. For such cargoes, bottom flush with water is not effective. Read the paint manufacturer’s instructions for the next cargo, as it may specify only warm organic cargoes. Pay attention to the footnotes.

Some cargoes that are detrimental to epoxy coating and better suited for stainless steel or zinc tanks are: acetone, acrylonitrile, ethanol, methanol, IPA, MEK, methyl acrylate, vinyl acetate monomer, etc.

##### Venting After Discharge of Toxic Cargo

Refer to IMS Chapter 8.1.7.

Venting of tanks after discharge of toxic cargo should be through the vessel’s approved gas-freeing outlets, ensuring the exit velocity is sufficient to carry the vapors clear of the deck in compliance with IBC Code 15.12.

The hazard involved in ventilating tanks after discharge of toxic cargo is mitigated using an approved venting system, meeting IBC Code 8.5.1 and 15.12.1.

Maintain the airflow rate into cargo tanks, considering the number of tanks being ventilated and the capacity of the ventilation fan, as per the P&A manual.

Ensure an effective eject velocity of at least 30 m/sec through the high-velocity vent, where fitted and used. Do not allow escape of cargo vapor at deck level before the concentration within the tank has fallen below 30% LEL and the relevant TLV.

Thereafter, final clearance of the vapor mixture may continue at tank deck level through other larger deck openings. In addition, follow the guidelines provided in TSG (Chemicals).

##### Specific Guidance for Tank Cleaning

Refer to the Tank Cleaning Miracle Software and Tank Cleaning Guide by Dr. Verwey. This complements the basic tank cleaning instructions in IMS Chapter 8.1.7 – Tank Cleaning

##### Emergency Discharge

###### Introduction

In case the Framo pump cannot be made operative from deck, use the portable cargo pump for discharging.

Lower the portable pump into the tank through a tank cleaning port. Refer to the Framo manual, portable cargo pump section, for setup and operation instructions.

Observe all necessary safety precautions relevant to the actual cargo when using a portable cargo pump. Always consult the with terminal/port authorities.

Caution: before discharging via the cargo hoses, verify the electrical conductivity

Storage of Portable Pumping Equipment

Store the portable pumping equipment in a clean and dry area, easily accessible. Store the concentric hose:

On a suitable hose reel

On brackets on the bulkhead, or

Lying on a shelf

The pump and hoses must always be safely supported and fastened to avoid wear or damage due to ship movements.

Caution!	Do not hang the hoses, or lay them over sharp edges, or place sharp objects upon them.

Emergency Discharge Procedure

The Chief Officer shall do this procedure.

Prepare a Detailed Cargo Handling Plan:

Include the use of a portable pump, if applicable.

Complete all relevant checklists for cargo operations.

Carry out a risk assessment

Consider the Physical Nature and Hazards of the Cargo:

Use MSDS sheets.

Refer to the handling instructions for specific cargoes (IMS Ch. 17.08).

Consult the IBC code.

Consider flammability, toxicity, corrosive, and caustic characteristics when planning the cargo transfer and performing the risk assessment.

Take Measures to Minimize Risk:

Use PPE.

Keep non-essential personnel off the deck.

Suspend non-essential operations while:

- Transfer is taking place.

- Transferring to an empty tank while at sea.

Note: Moving the pump within the cargo tank is a critical operation. Attempt this only under the strict supervision of the Master, who will permit this operation only after carefully considering all relevant risks.

Comply with Special Requirements:

Follow the IBC code Chapter 17, MARPOL Annex I, and charterer’s requirements regarding tank cleanliness, nitrogen, and heating.

Note: Personnel safety and cargo integrity must be paramount.

Isolate the Tank Being Discharged:

Isolate the tank discharged with the portable pump from other cargo tanks containing the same parcel of cargo by all possible means.

If possible, transfer the cargo from the affected tank to another empty tank prepared to the required cleanliness standard and preferably accepted by the assigned surveyor.

You may pump to the shore tank only after the cargo in the “buffer” tank has been sampled, analyzed, and confirmed to be within specifications.

Notify Relevant Parties:

Inform the operations department and local port operations.

Notify local port and port state authorities and terminal management of the intention to discharge using the portable pump.

Plan for any prewashes required.

Record all reporting and correspondence in this regard, as well as requirements and permissions granted.

Keep the office well informed and abreast of preparations and operations so they may fulfill any reporting requirements to the customers, port or flag states, or port authorities.

Pre-Operational Checks:

Check the impeller for tightness and clearance.

Rig the pump such that it can run at full speed for at least fifteen minutes. After this period, visually inspect the pump and hoses for leaks.

Note: This inspection should include opening the cofferdam.

Refer to the Framo instruction manual on how to inspect the cofferdam.

If any oil or water is found in the cofferdam, change the seals.

After use, thoroughly clean, inspect, and overhaul the pump if necessary.

Note: Do not leave a pump with hydraulic hoses rigged exposed to Sun for long periods unless fully connected to the main system. The expansion of hydraulic oil in the hoses can burst the hydraulic seal in the portable pump.

Prepare a Tank Cleaning Plan:

Prepare a tank cleaning plan considering the use of the portable pump.

Prepare a separate risk assessment with the tank cleaning plan.

Consider minimizing risks during the cleaning operation.

Repair or Replace the Cargo Pump:

Make a full report of actions taken in the PMS.

Record a brief entry in the remarks section of the Framo Purging Routines Log. Include max stripping quantity violations and the possibility of requiring a mandatory MARPOL prewash after using the portable pump.

Protect Cargo Quality:

Take measures to protect cargo quality and avoid contamination due to the use of the portable pump via an open hatch.

Take precautions to reduce the escape of cargo vapors through the open hatch.

Note: 	Always refer to Framo Portable cargo pump manual for detailed operational procedure.

##### Overhaul of Framo Pump, Safety/Environmental Issues

This is a high-pressure system. Take great care when opening any parts on the hydraulic side. Complete a permit to work form and a risk assessment form.

Personnel operating this equipment must wear appropriate PPE, as per the PPE Matrix.

Special cargoes may require additional precautions or procedures. Refer to the handling instructions for specific cargoes in IMS Ch. 8.2.4 - Handling Instructions for Specific Cargoes, and the IBC code.

Consider additional precautions to prevent any risk of pollution due to the spillage/leakage of hydraulic oil. Such leaks/spills also present a hazard to personnel due to slips and falls, which should be prevented by an adequate and timely response with prepared equipment.

Caution: Do not enter tanks containing hazardous cargo. Clean tanks properly and make tank entry as per enclosed space entry procedures.

##### Failure of Stripping Performance

The stripping ability of a cargo tank may fail due to:

Breakdown of the pump after unloading

Broken or blocked stripping line within the tank

Blowing medium not available

Use of the portable pump to unload the cargo

Note: The tank is no longer certified with respect to stripping performance.

For cargoes requiring a prewash with delivery of the prewashing water to a reception facility (refer to the P&A manual), normal procedures may be followed, except that an extended prewash may be required by the government-appointed surveyor.

For other Category Y and Z substances, stripping cannot be regarded as failed unless there remain more than 75 liters on board in each tank with its cargo system.

If an excessive amount remains in any cargo tank/piping system, carry out a prewash as far as possible as per addendum B of the P&A Manual.

Discharge the prewash water to a reception facility in the unloading port.

In the absence of suitable shore reception facilities, consult the local government-appointed surveyor to obtain shore assistance to reduce the residues in the tank to acceptable quantities or to obtain permission in writing to carry slops to another port with a suitable reception facility.

##### Failure of Tank Heating System

If an individual tank's heating system fails, heat substances in adjacent tanks, if permissible, to transmit heat through common bulkheads.

Alternatively, if the cargo is not water-sensitive, inject steam directly. Keep adjoining ballast double hull tanks and cofferdams empty if seawater temperature is below cargo temperature or filled with hot water via deck.

If unable to heat the cargo sufficiently to make it a non-solidifying and low-viscosity substance, then follow the procedures applicable to solidifying or high-viscosity substances.

##### Cargo Tanks Venting System

The venting capacity of every tank is required by SOLAS to be 125% of the maximum loading rate of that tank—the additional 25% is to allow for gas evolution.

However, this allowance can be exceeded when loading high vapor pressure cargoes. Note that vapor growth increases when the liquid levels in the tank are above 80%.

Venting systems must release vapor to the atmosphere either:

At a low velocity, high above the deck from a vent riser, or

At high velocity from a high-velocity valve closer to the deck.

Both methods facilitate the dilution of the vapor in the atmosphere well clear of the deck. Vents are sited to prevent the accumulation of an explosive atmosphere on the tank deck or around the accommodation or engine room housings.

###### Primary and Secondary Venting Systems

Refer to IMS Chapter 8.1.5 – Inert Gas Management.

The primary venting system consists of the individual cargo tank P/V valves. The secondary venting system is a cargo tank pressure monitoring system. All vessels have one or more common vapor lines, and some are fitted with inert gas, either an inert gas plant or a nitrogen distribution system.

Use the venting system during all cargo operations and, when possible, during the venting of cargo tanks. Maintain both the primary and secondary venting systems in good order. Inform the office in case of failure of either system.

###### Operation and Maintenance of the Venting System

Refer to IMS Chapter 8.1.5 – Inert Gas Management.

At the start of any cargo operation, check that valves and lines are correctly set to avoid tank pressurization or vacuum development. Form a system to control the setting of the ventilation system. The procedure should include:

A method of recording the status of all valves and preventing them from being incorrectly or casually operated

Setting the valves in the correct position for each operation and monitoring that they remain correctly set

Restricting the operation of vent system valves to authorized personnel only

The vapor system may be common for those tanks carrying the same product but must remain separate under the following circumstances:

Where a different product is being carried

Where both volatile and non-volatile cargo is being carried

Where cross-contamination of the vapor will result in contamination of any part of the cargo

Where some tanks are empty

Check vent lines, valves, and pressure indicating devices regularly for correct operation, especially during freezing weather.

Monitor cargo tank pressure continuously and take immediate corrective action where over or under-pressurization of a tank is suspected.

Several cargoes freeze at temperatures well above zero, and solidification of their vapor within the venting system can result in blockage.

Note: The most prudent action will be to stop the operation and investigate the problem.

The cargo plan must contain clear, unambiguous operating procedures for the proper management and control of the venting system for the OOW.

##### Pressure/Vacuum Valves

Complete the form CHEM-02 “Cargo System Maximum Capacities” and keep it in the forms file. Obtain the opening and closing pressures from the manufacturers’ instruction manual.

Some vessels are equipped with P/V valves that allow use of different pressure release settings for the carriage of cargoes with specific pressure requirements. A list of some of those cargoes is included at the end of this chapter.

Monitor the operation of P/V valves during loading.

If a valve shows any sign of leakage, investigate the cause and stop the leakage. The pressure valve of a high-velocity P/V valve is designed to open at a pre-calculated pressure, resulting in an exit velocity of the gas being ejected at least 30 meters/second.

The design of the cone ensures the gas is ejected in a vertical stream upwards. Flame screens are not fitted in the pressure valve. Operate the valve correctly to prevent the passage of flame.

Note: Flame travels at approximately 7 meters/second.

The required exit velocity of the gas stream is not achieved when a pressure valve is ‘chattering’ or ‘hammering’—i.e., bouncing rapidly up and down. An ignition source close to the pressure valve might ignite the hydrocarbons and enter the tank with disastrous consequences. Do not allow this to happen.

There are two causes of pressure valve ‘chatter’:

The loading rate is excessive, resulting in a rapid build-up of pressure within the tank. The valve needs to open as soon as it has closed. This generally occurs when the tank is nearly full because of the lack of vapor space. The designed loading rate may be exceeded and must be reduced immediately.

The pressure valve is either dirty or faulty and should therefore be investigated and either cleaned or repaired.

‘Chattering’ of the vacuum valve of a P/V valve, where the tanks are not pressurized with inert gas, is quite normal during discharging operations and is not a matter of concern.

Important:

Check the smooth operation of both the pressure and vacuum valves manually before any cargo operation and record the results.

Note: Pressure valves open completely in one movement—partial lifting will result in a significantly reduced exit velocity of the gas.

The pressure valve should open smoothly, fully, and instantaneously at a pre-calculated pressure.

Pressure valves must ‘snap’ shut and seal the vent when the tank reaches a lower pre-determined pressure level.

The valves must operate freely with no signs of sticking.

Monitor the pressure at which each pressure valve lifts and shuts during loading operations to ensure compliance with design requirements.

Check pressure and vacuum valves regularly for leakage during cargo operations. Rectify any signs of leakage.

Check the flame screens of vacuum valves regularly to ensure they are in good condition and intact.

Note: Consider P/V valves as critical equipment that needs to be kept correctly functional.

Caution: Do not inhibit the operation of a P/V valve on a cargo tank or fit any modifications.

###### Minimizing Hazards from Vented Gas

Control venting of cargo vapor to prevent escape to the atmosphere unless the vented gas compound has less than 30% LFL and the relevant TLV.

Atmospheric conditions—usually calm hot weather—may result in significant accumulations of gas on deck and around the accommodation. This is a dangerous situation if handling toxic products.

If loading, consider stopping cargo operations until the situation improves. Take adequate precautions to protect personnel.

Note:	If a fixed ventilation system is available on board, disconnect the ventilation system from the cargo/venting systems when it is not in use.

##### Heated Chemical Cargoes

###### Segregation of Heated Cargoes

Stow heated cargoes in adjacent tanks to:

Economize on cargo heating

Avoid heating other cargo that does not require it

If not separated by a cofferdam, the boiling point of an unheated cargo should be at least 50°C higher than the maximum carriage temperature of an adjacent heated cargo.

Do not heat cargo stowed adjacent to cargo that is self-reactive, unless separated by a cofferdam.

Note: Heat may transfer through an empty cofferdam if the temperature of the heated cargo is high.

Monitor the temperature of tanks containing a self-reactive cargo when near a heated cargo.

Do not stow a heated cargo adjacent to toxic products to minimize the risk of gas evolution.

Do not stow cargoes with a melting temperature above 15°C directly adjacent to the hull.

###### Monitoring Cargo Temperature

When heating is required, monitor the cargo temperature at least daily during sea passage. Record the temperatures in form TANK-49.

Use closed temperature-monitoring systems whenever possible. If hand measurement of temperature is necessary during the voyage, be aware of, and take steps to avoid, the following:

The escape of toxic gas

The ingress of water into a tank

Pressure in the tank resulting in the expulsion of toxic or corrosive cargo droplets from the aperture being used to monitor the temperature

Injury due to the vessel shipping seas on deck in adverse weather

Wear the required PPE.

###### Draining Heated Cargoes

During discharge, continue heating until the cargo is at the level of the coils to assist with draining. Discontinue heating before the bottom coils are exposed.

Strip the heated cargo as dry as possible immediately after discontinuing the heating. Drain only a minimum number of tanks at a time to allow for adequate control.

##### Cargo Heating Systems

###### Heating Medium

The heating medium should be approved for use with the particular cargo. Some cargoes, such as Isocyanates, TDI, PAPI, and MDI, react dangerously with water, and therefore steam heating is not permitted. Only thermal oil or external heating is permitted.

###### Steam Heating

Open steam inlet valves very gradually to avoid rapid thermal expansion of the heating coil and subsequent risk of damage. Open the return drains to allow any entrapped water to escape on deck and then close them when steam appears.

If you detect oil leakage, blank off the affected heating coil and repair it at the earliest opportunity. Wherever possible, blank off the tank loop. Leakage after heating has commenced would be indicated by heavy water consumption or an unexpected increase in tank volume.

An indication of leakage in a steam heater system is oil on the surface of the water in the observation tank. Any more than a few drops will require remedial action.

###### Other Heating Medium

Other cargo heating systems include hot water and thermal oil. They operate on the same basic principle, although some are individual units for each tank, with the cargo circulated through a heater by the individual tank cargo pump.

Maintain a record if any part of a thermal oil heating system has been isolated for any reason.

##### Heating Sensitive Cargoes

Strictly adhere to the charterer’s heating requirements. Some cargoes, although requiring heating, are sensitive to:

Too high a level of heat

Heating being too rapidly applied

These cargoes include acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, which need to be kept within a temperature range of 15°C to 30°C. Maintain good control of the cargo temperature with such cargoes and monitor the temperature as frequently as necessary.

##### The Use of External Heating

###### Introduction

External heating can be an effective method of maintaining the temperature of a particular cargo. Provided there are at least two adjacent heated tanks, the heating is applied evenly over a large surface area, thus avoiding the possibility of overheating the cargo at the heating coils.

###### Procedure for External Heating

Follow these procedures when using external heating:

A minimum of two, but preferably three, adjacent tanks depending on the season and area, should be loaded with a heated cargo.

The minimum carriage temperature of the adjacent tanks must not exceed the maximum allowed temperature of the cargo in the tank that requires heating.

The maximum allowed carriage temperature of the adjacent tanks must be sufficient to heat the cargo in the tank that requires heating.

The maximum allowed temperature of the adjacent tanks should not exceed 20°C above the maximum temperature of the cargo that requires heat.

The ullage of the adjacent tanks should be nearly identical to that of the tank that requires heat.

####### Prior to Loading

Load the adjacent tanks required for heating before the tank that requires heat.

Ensure the temperature of the tank that requires heat is as close as possible to the minimum or maximum allowed for the cargo to be loaded.

Calculate the maximum percentage to fill the tank, considering the heat expansion ratio of the cargo and the possibility of the cargo tank becoming full during the voyage.

####### During the Voyage

Monitor the temperature of both the heated and the adjacent tanks closely. Record at least twice daily (or more frequently if the charterer requires it).

Set the temperature alarm (when available) below the maximum allowed temperature on both the tanks that require heat and those providing external heating.

The temperature of the cargo being heated must not be increased by more than 5°C in a 24-hour period.

####### Discharging

Discharge the cargo that requires heat whenever possible before discharging the adjacent heated tanks.

If required to discharge one or more of the adjacent heated tanks before the heated tank, evaluate the ambient temperatures in the area and the time until the heated cargo will be discharged, considering the possibility of unforeseen delays.

##### Precautions to Avoid Unintended Cargo Heating

The tank coating manufacturer will provide the maximum temperature permitted to avoid excessive thermal stress or damage to the coating. Do not exceed this maximum temperature.

Do not heat cargo above 60°C without permission from the office.

Vessels with coated tanks shall record the maximum temperature that the coating manufacturers recommend a tank may be heated on the form CHEM-02 “Cargo System Maximum Capacities” and keep it in the ship’s files for reference.

Heat the cargo only to the temperature required in the voyage orders. Avoid rapid changes in temperature, which may also adversely affect the quality of the cargo.

The master should contact the operator, if in doubt.

The chief officer should:

- Plan heating requirements

- Discuss the plan with the master

- Liaise closely with the chief engineer to ensure:

- Cargo heating system is tested before use

- There are no leaks

- Will be available when required

##### Carriage and Cleaning of Solidifying Cargo.

Solidifying substance means a noxious liquid substance which:

Has a melting point of less than 15°C and is at a temperature of less than 5°C above its melting point at the time of unloading; or

Has a melting point equal to or greater than 15°C and is at a temperature of less than 10°C above its melting point at the time of unloading.

###### Carry solidifying substances in tanks:

With heating arrangements.

Not adjacent to ballast tanks filled with water, which would act as a cooler.

Maintain solidifying substances at temperatures well above their melting point to ensure they remain pumpable at all times.

Solidifying cargo poses the risk of blocking pipes, valves, and vents if the required temperature regime is not maintained. This can lead to over or under pressure in cargo tanks and eventually the inability to load or discharge the cargo.

###### When carrying such substances, consider limitations such as:

Tank coating resistance to heating.

Ambient temperature.

Existence of uninsulated cargo pipes.

Vents and valves.

Output of the ship’s heating system.

High viscous oil or liquid left inside a closed piping system can severely damage the system or cause leakage/rupture of gaskets, expansion joints, or flanges due to expansion inside, as the liquid temperature rises inside the system.

Such incidents on deck could cause oil pollution; inside tanks, it might trigger cargo contamination, e.g., top loading lines and small diameter lines.

###### Avoiding damages cargo system

Include instructions on how to displace cargo in the lines upon completion of transfer operations in the cargo transfer plan. Discuss this with shore facility representatives.

Do not leave cargo in the deck piping at the end of cargo transfer operations; drop it into the cargo tanks.

Sometimes, ballast water left unmonitored inside pump room lines could cause leakages at flanges when proceeding to warmer regions.

Take preventive measures against solidification inside tanks and pipelines after heated cargo is loaded or discharged.

Air in such locked systems can be more readily compressed and cause less damage compared to liquid entrapped in a closed system. Obtain the properties of the solidifying substance from the shipping document prior to loading.

Refer to the IBC Code, where column “o” in the table of Chapter 17 refers to paragraph 16 of the IBC Code. The cargo viscosity at 20°C and the melting point shall be indicated in the shipping document. If the cargo viscosity exceeds 50 mPa.s at 20°C, the temperature at which the cargo has a viscosity of 50 mPa.s shall be specified in the shipping document.

Check the vessel’s heating system and steam generator for efficiency and integrity prior to loading. Keep the steam generator in standby mode and connect steam hoses ready for immediate use for heating uninsulated cargo pipes, valves, and vents if required.

Discuss the possibility of an external source of heating and means of connection to the vessel’s system with the terminal prior to discharging operations. In case of heating system failure, follow the procedure as described in the P&A Manual.

Perform a pre-wash as per MARPOL Annex II cargoes. Wash tanks with hot water (unless the properties of such substances make washing less effective) in preferably heated tanks. Keep washing machines operating long enough to flush the pipeline, pump, and filter, and discharge to reception facilities. Continue until the tank is empty. Steam is more efficient for cleaning cargo lines and vents.

Caution: Do not introduce steam if a flammable atmosphere exists (hazard of static electricity).

Discharge residues of solidifying substances in compliance with MARPOL Annex II. Crew shall exercise caution when attending to valves, tank openings, and pressurized pipelines throughout cargo operations and the carriage of heated cargo.

##### Reactive Cargo – Use of Inhibitors

Unstable chemicals can self-react without the need for another substance to trigger a reaction. Decomposition or polymerization are the most typical reactions that can occur within unstable chemicals carried on board chemical tankers.

Chemicals that polymerize, such as styrene monomer and vinyl acetate monomer, have a unique property that allows individual molecules to combine with each other to form long-chain polymers.

Most polymerization reactions are exothermic and are characterized by an accelerating reaction rate until all the monomer molecules are consumed.

Polymerization is often initiated by high temperatures or by reaction with small amounts of impurities that act as a catalyst. The most common impurities that create polymerization are acids, alkalis, and metals.

###### Polymerization of a monomer cargo

The generation of heat that accelerates the speed of the chemical reaction.

The rapid expansion of the product that causes over-pressurization of the cargo tank with a consequent danger of rupture.

The rupture of the tank may lead to chemical reactions with other cargoes in adjacent tanks.

While a monomer cargo may often be a light and volatile liquid in its stable form, the polymerization process produces heavier and more viscous liquids, or even solids, which may block the tank vents so that the pressure inside the tank increases even further.

As a precaution against this, terminal personnel may add a chemical inhibitor during loading to prevent the cargo from bonding with itself. However, one characteristic of inhibitors is that they sometimes require oxygen to activate them and, as such, the tank cannot be inerted.

Shippers must advise the vessel of:

Quantity of inhibitor added.

How to add the inhibitor to the cargo.

How the inhibitor should be mixed with the cargo.

Hazards of the inhibitor.

Time validity of the inhibitor.

Temperature parameters within which the inhibitor will work.

Emergency actions should these be exceeded.

Masters must check that the inhibitor validity is sufficient for the voyage length.

Under the IBC Code, a certificate of protection must be provided for cargoes that are required to be inhibited during the voyage.

It is also a requirement of the Code that for such cargoes, unless a certificate of protection is supplied, the cargo must be rejected and not loaded. Shippers must present an inhibitor certificate of protection on board prior to loading.

The certificate of protection from the manufacturer should specify:

The name and amount of additive present.

Whether the additive is oxygen-dependent and, if so, the minimum level of oxygen required in the vapor space of the tank for the inhibitor to be effective must be specified.

Date the additive was put in the product and duration of effectiveness.

Any temperature limitations qualifying the additive's effective lifetime.

The action to be taken should the length of the voyage exceed the effective lifetime of the additive.

During the voyage, the following should be observed for inhibited cargoes:

Monitor the temperature daily.

Monitor the vapor space for the correct level of oxygen if the inhibitor is oxygen-dependent.

Monitor adjacent temperatures.

Should the temperature rise higher than expected, taking into account the ambient conditions and the temperature of adjacent cargoes, treat this as an emergency and take appropriate action (see Chapter 10 of the IBC Code).

A polymerizing cargo will generate a lot of heat with a rapid rise in temperature and increase in pressure, so the vessel should always have a contingency plan ready to jettison the cargo. The vapor of the cargo will not necessarily contain inhibitor as the two liquids will have differing evaporation properties. Therefore, it is possible for some solid polymer build-up to occur in the tank vents/screens.

Check the tank vents/screens during the voyage and prior to commencing discharge to avoid damage from under-pressure being created in the tanks during discharge.

Check the temperature of inhibited cargoes and record it daily to note any abnormal rise that may indicate either inhibitor failure or polymerization. Inform the office immediately if any rise or excessive temperatures are noticed and request advice on the action to be taken.

##### Cargo Cooling

If necessary to cool cargo, take care that water will not induce a reaction with the cargo involved. Water on deck should, under normal circumstances, not cause any problems.

Methods of Cargo Cooling:

1. Water Spraying: Spraying sea water on the deck using hoses or hydrants is one of the most effective ways of cooling a cargo, particularly in hotter climates. The cargo can be significantly cooled by this method, provided that the sea temperature is lower than that of the cargo.

2. Use of Heating Coils: Passing colder water through the heating coils must only be adopted if permitted by the IBC Code and if the cargo does not react with water. Use only fresh water, either from the ship’s fresh water system or from a source such as river water. If using sea water in an emergency, thoroughly flush the heating coils afterward.

3. Adjacent Ballast and Cargo Tanks: If the sea temperature is less than that of the cargo, filling adjacent ballast or cargo tanks with water can give satisfactory results. Adopt this method only if permitted by the IBC Code and if the cargo does not react with water.

##### Use of Nitrogen

###### Introduction

Use nitrogen as a medium for inerting for:

Cargo quality control.

Safety reasons.

Using nitrogen in cargo handling is dictated either by the IBC Code or by customer demands for cargo quality. Nitrogen is used to obtain and maintain a controlled atmosphere. By replacing the air atmosphere with nitrogen, we control the atmosphere concerning:

Fire and explosion hazards.

Unwanted reactions between cargo and air.

Moisture pick-up by cargo.

Nitrogen is used for:

Purging of line and tank before loading.

Blanketing of cargoes after loading.

Maintenance of nitrogen blanket during the voyage.

Nitrogen displacement during discharge, inerting of void spaces, and surrounding cargo tanks.

Complete the form TANK-21 “IGS Operational Log” whenever nitrogen is used for blanketing or purging.

###### Using Nitrogen - Safety Precautions

Nitrogen is:

Lighter than both air and inert gas.

An extremely dangerous gas because it is undetected by human senses.

Not toxic, but one single breath of nitrogen can cause immediate death.

Note: This is because the body reacts to significant concentrations of nitrogen in a way that the brain no longer ‘sends a message’ to the lungs to breathe. Immediate death results, even when the person is removed from the source and is in clean air.

Where inerted with nitrogen, post a notice using form CHEM-04 on the tank access hatch and on every open aperture throughout the time the tank remains inerted with nitrogen while in port and when carrying out cargo operations at sea.

Take care when opening the lids and hatches of a tank that has been inerted with nitrogen. Only the master may allow the opening of any tank aperture where a tank has been inerted, padded, or purged with nitrogen.

Consider the following when inerting, purging, or padding with nitrogen:

Nitrogen can cause oxygen deficiency in confined spaces, exhaust openings, on deck during purging of the tank, and in void spaces.

Note: To safeguard against accidents caused by oxygen deficiency, observe all safety precautions mentioned elsewhere in this manual.

Nitrogen can cause accidents when handled under pressure due to the risk of over-pressurization of the cargo tank. Monitor the pressure continually.

To prevent structural damage, always have a pressure gauge (minus 0.5 to plus 1.0 bar) and a shut-off valve fitted. Monitor the pressure when adding nitrogen to a closed tank. If the pressure in the tank exceeds the opening pressure of the P/V valve, reduce the nitrogen supply momentarily to avoid pressurization of the tank.

Overflow: If supplied after cargo has been loaded, there may be a risk of overflow, particularly if the tank is 98% full and is inerted through the cargo line.

Liquid nitrogen: Sometimes liquid nitrogen might be delivered on board, mainly from road tankers. This can cause an extremely dangerous situation as the liquid will rapidly expand and cause immediate over-pressurization.

###### Preparing a Cargo Tank Atmosphere

For some cargoes, the IBC Code requires vapor spaces within cargo tanks to have specially controlled atmospheres, principally when the cargo:

Is air-reactive, resulting in a hazardous situation.

Has a low auto-ignition temperature.

Has a wide flammability range.

Often it will be necessary to reduce the humidity (dew point) of the atmosphere within the cargo system. The cargo shippers will normally specify the extent of atmosphere control required to protect the quality of the cargo.

###### Quality of Nitrogen

The nitrogen supplied from a shore facility will generally be of the order of 99.999% purity (10 ppm of O2). This ensures that maximum displacement of oxygen takes place. When replacing nitrogen cylinders, order the correct quality. Some clients permit the use of only 99.999% nitrogen and have such stocks placed at strategic ports. Contact the charterer prior to placing an order.

####### Receiving Nitrogen from Shore

Carry out a risk assessment considering all involved hazards and required mitigating measures. Chemical loading terminals frequently supply nitrogen to dry a cargo tank through the piping system, either for:

Purging the tank before loading.

Padding cargo in a tank after loading.

The nitrogen supplied may be at high pressure (10 bar) and high flow rate. Discuss the handling procedure with the terminal staff during the pre-transfer conference. When loading, allow the existing atmosphere in the tank to escape through a vent pipe, which is noticeably smaller than the liquid filling line, because friction and turbulence are far greater impediments to liquid flow than gas flow.

However, when a gas is being introduced through a liquid filling line, especially a gas under pressure that will expand in the tank, the same condition does not apply, and dissimilar sizes between inlet and outlet pipes can allow overpressure to develop. To avoid overpressure, it may be necessary to have a cargo tank lid or washing hatch open.

The following table indicates the volume of nitrogen that can be received in one minute through a known size of pipe at a known pressure and the time to receive 5,000 m³ nitrogen, as per the Tanker Safety Guide – Chemicals:

5.2 bar (75 psi)		1,771 / min

Cubic meters of gas at various gauge pressures received in 1 minute through lines of various sizes. The figure in brackets indicates the associated hourly rate, which should be compared to a liquid loading rate.

The above example assumes a cargo tank of 1,250 cubic meters requiring four atmosphere changes, i.e. 5,000 cubic meters of Nitrogen, to flow through.

The above tables are indicative only, and any discrepancies are due to the rounding of figures.

When cargo is carried under a pad of nitrogen supplied from shore, it is better to purge the entire cargo tank before loading.

After such purging, loading the cargo in a closed condition will create the needed pad within the tank. Reduce the risk of over pressurization by avoiding padding with shore-supplied nitrogen, as a separate procedure at end of loading.

However, if this is not possible, then the supply of shore nitrogen should be done through a small diameter pipe to restrict the flow, and the supply rate must not exceed the venting capacity of the cargo tank.

When preparing to receive nitrogen from shore, place special emphasis on the following points:

- Ship and shore should agree in writing on the gas supply, specifying the volume required, the flow rate in standard cubic meters per minute, and the maxima in each case.

- Operate the valves on the loading line between the shore manifold and the ship’s tank(s) in the correct sequence so that the ship is in control of the nitrogen flow.

- Position a crew member at the loading manifold, even when remote operated valves are available, since it the best position for prompt reaction to any indication of external trouble .

- Ensure that a tank to be dried or inerted has open vents with a greater flow rate capacity than the inlet, such that the tank is not pressurized. Achieve this by opening a cargo tank lid or washing hatch.

- If local requirements demand a closed venting of the tank through a vapour return line to shore, the nitrogen flow rate and pressure should not exceed the capacity of the venting system. Agree to a positive measure to achieve.

- Monitor the tank(s) pressure closely during the operation

Special care is necessary when supplying nitrogen as a gas directly from evaporating liquid nitrogen, sometimes delivered by a road tanker fitted with a vaporizer.

Note:	You cannot control the volume and flow rate and the agreed delivery figures may suddenly be exceeded.

The vaporization ratio between nitrogen’s liquid/gaseous forms is 1/640. When any of this expansion is happening in the delivery pipeline the flow will be dramatically increased, becomes uncontrollable and high pressures can be reached quickly.

If the ship suspects that traces of liquid nitrogen are arriving at the manifold, (possible indication is the formation of ice on the ship’s lines) suspend the operation until the apparent problems have been satisfactorily resolved.

###### Use of Nitrogen with Inhibited Cargoes

For inhibited cargo, ensure that the tank is not inerted or padded if the inhibitor is oxygen dependent. If an oxygen-dependent inhibitor is added to the cargo, monitor the oxygen content of the vapor space daily and complete the form CHEM-03 “Atmosphere Check – Cargo Tank Oxygen Content.”

When a product containing an oxygen-dependent inhibitor is carried in a ship where inerting is required under SOLAS regulation II 2/4.5.5, as amended, inert gas shall not be applied before loading or during the voyage but shall be applied before commencement of unloading.

###### Loss of Nitrogen Supply

In the event of loss of nitrogen supply when handling cargoes requiring nitrogen padding, take the following actions as per cases of IGS failure:

Stop cargo operations until the cause of the problem is resolved and the normal nitrogen supply is restored.

Inform the office for further guidance and instructions.

If carrying cargoes that require inerting and repair of the inert gas system is impracticable, resume cargo operations only if connected to an external supply of inert gas or if the precautions outlined in the section on static electricity for cargo operations in a non-inert tank are strictly followed. Inform the office before this takes place.

###### Nitrogen Padding or Blanketing Requirement

Nitrogen blanketing or padding creates a positive pressure in a tank filled with cargo, preventing the ingress of air or water and thus preventing possible dangerous reactions or damage between the cargo and water/air.

A responsible officer must supervise the blanketing procedures. The officer in charge must ensure that all personnel not involved in these operations are restricted from the area.

Note: Padding via the cargo lines (bubbling through the cargo) is recommended only for low viscosity cargoes.

Three methods of blanketing after gauging and sampling are available:

Blanketing after loading with open venting/gauging:

This method normally does not create any danger/hazards but exercise the following care:

The shore may supply the nitrogen through the same hose/line used for loading the cargo. The supply pressure must be sufficient to cover some liquid head in the tank plus the PV setting.

Discuss this information during the preload conference, including the precautions the shore will take. Ensure the operation is through a small hose and that the rate will not exceed the vent capacity of the tank cargo. If shore is unable to comply, inform the office before the operation.

Take care that the cargo does not overflow from the tank.

Blanketing after loading with controlled venting/closed or restricted gauging, without vapor return:

Where possible, fit a pressure gauge to the tank (scale minus 0.5 to plus 1.0 bar). The tank vapor pressure sensor will provide a continuous reading of tank vapor pressure.

Place the P/V-valve gas freeing cover in the open position.

If nitrogen is supplied by the ship, connect the nitrogen supply hose to the cargo line at the manifold or applicable tank connection.

The shore may supply the nitrogen through the same hose/line used for loading the cargo. The supply pressure must be sufficient to cover some liquid head in the tank plus the PV setting.

Discuss this information during the preload conference, including the precautions the shore will take. Ensure the operation is through a small hose and that the rate will not exceed the vent capacity of the tank cargo.

In all cases, ensure that the volume of nitrogen being supplied (size of the line and pressure refer to the guideline charts in the ICS Chemical Tanker Safety Guide) is not greater than what the P/V valve can handle. If shore is unable to comply, inform the office before the operation.

Ensure the cargo line valves to the tank are open.

Carefully open the valve controlling the nitrogen supply.

Closely monitor the pressure in the tank during the blanketing.

When the required tank atmosphere is reached, shut off the nitrogen supply and close the valves.

Place the P/V-valve in automatic position and close the gas freeing cover.

If a positive pressure is required, slowly reopen the nitrogen supply while closely monitoring the pressure.

When the required pressure is reached, shut down the nitrogen supply and close all valves.

Blanketing after loading with controlled venting/closed or restricted gauging, with vapor return:

Where possible, fit a pressure gauge to the tank (scale minus 0.5 to plus 1.0 bar). The tank vapor pressure sensor will provide a continuous reading of tank vapor pressure.

Ensure that the vapor return system remains open throughout the blanketing operation.

For ship-supplied nitrogen, connect the nitrogen supply hose to the cargo line at the manifold or applicable tank connection.

The shore may supply the nitrogen through the same hose/line used for loading the cargo. The supply pressure must be sufficient to cover some liquid head in the tank plus the PV setting.

Discuss this information during the preload conference, including the precautions the shore will take. Ensure the operation is through a small hose and that the rate will not exceed the vent capacity of the tank cargo.

Ensure the volume of nitrogen being supplied (size of the line and pressure refer to the guideline charts in the ICS Chemical Tanker Safety Guide) is not greater than what the P/V valve can handle. If shore is unable to comply, inform the office before the operation.

Ensure the appropriate valve(s) to the tank are open.

Carefully open the valve controlling the nitrogen supply.

Closely monitor the pressure in the tank during the blanketing.

When the required atmosphere is reached, shut off the nitrogen supply and close the valves, including the vapor return system (ship’s valve).

If a positive pressure is required upon completion of blanketing, reduce the nitrogen supply pressure. Slowly throttle down the vapor return valve.

When the required pressure is reached, shut down the nitrogen supply and close the valves, including the vapor return valve.

WARNING:

Never over-pressurize a cargo tank (above the P/V valve setting)

###### Nitrogen Blanket with Positive Pressure during Voyage

When blanketed by nitrogen, maintain the quality of nitrogen and the blanket as per instructions received. For certain cargoes, the IBC/BCH codes specify maintaining the blanket under positive pressure.

Some shippers may set additional requirements for certain cargoes with a nitrogen blanket under positive pressure. Always maintain the positive pressure of the nitrogen blanket at 50 mBar, unless otherwise specified by the charterer.

When placed after loading, monitor the pressure of the blanket closely for a period to verify that the tank is holding the pressure.

If you encounter problems in maintaining the positive pressure, check and rectify any leaks. When the tank and line system are verified tight, use the arrangement for automatic feeding of nitrogen.

Take readings and record the pressure at regular intervals, not exceeding 12 hours. Record daily the consumption of nitrogen, pressure, and oxygen in the log.

####### Nitrogen Blanket without Positive Pressure

Check and record the ullage space environment (oxygen content or dew point) immediately after the blanket has been put on after loading. If there is no instruction to maintain oxygen or nitrogen pressure, do not add nitrogen during the voyage. Record daily the pressure and oxygen levels in the log.

##### Management of Flexible Cargo Hoses

Chemical cargo hoses can be made of polypropylene, stainless steel, Teflon, or composite materials. Proper management and maintenance are crucial for their longevity and safe operation.

Storage and Cleaning:

Stow hoses respectfully in a sheltered place at the manifold.

Clean cargo hoses after use and before testing or prolonged storage. If possible, perform initial cleaning while hoses are connected between the tank being washed and the slop tank.

Hang the fresh water rinsed/cleaned hoses vertically to facilitate proper drainage of the rinsing medium.

Note: When hoses are disconnected and the cargo being transferred is considered an "easy cargo", fresh water rinsing or live steaming may suffice as final cleaning.

Steaming Hoses:

Steam hoses in a vertical position. Collect the condensation in a clear glass sample bottle and test for clarity and pH.

Note: When cargo hoses are live steamed in a horizontal position, cargo residue is not easily removed from the inner lining.

Electrical Earth and Storage:

Electrically earth the hoses to prevent static charge build-up, especially when live steamed near flammable areas. Stow them with both ends blanked.

When applying live steam, flange the steam hose to one end of the cargo hose and leave the other end un-flanged. "Free steam" the steam hose before connecting it to a cargo hose to assure its cleanliness.

Cargo hoses with limited heat resistance must be live steamed for short periods only. Do not exceed the maximum temperature recommended by the manufacturer during live steaming.

Special Care for Polypropylene Hoses:

Polypropylene hoses are destroyed by excess heat and UV light. Do not kink hoses. Hang the hoses from their flanges when lifting by crane.

Check insulation when dry. Resistance should not exceed 6 ohms per meter length (Consult ISGOTT).

Certification and Marking:

Reconcile the hose markings with their certificates and manufacturers' resistance suitability. If the certificate number is not on the flange, punch it on an SS tag and attach it to the hose or at least paint it.

Do not accept new hoses without the hose manufacturer’s certificate and hose resistance booklet.

Number the hoses to track their usage. This allows maintaining records of the last three cargoes handled by them.

Note: For stainless steel hoses discharging sulfuric acid, replace them with non-stainless steel acid-resistant hoses before cleaning starts. Sulfuric acid in 30 to 70% concentration is non-oxidizing and attacks stainless steel rapidly, particularly at high temperatures.

Caution: Do not ‘pig’ cargo hoses.

Inspection and Handling:

Prior to every use, visually inspect the hose for kinks, bulges, soft spots, and cuts that penetrate the first layer of hose reinforcement.

Secure the hoses against rolling and do not allow hoses to touch steam pipes.

When discharging to barges at anchorage, use a chafing pad to protect the hoses due to ship movement.

At the manifold, support the hoses by flat saddles at least at two points. Do not use a rope directly to support the hose.

Hoses must not bend at a radius less than recommended by the manufacturer.

Check electrical conductivity before use and as per PMS schedule.

Testing:

Test a prototype to 5 times the design pressure. The working pressure is 1/5 of the bursting pressure.

In service, test hoses to 1.5 times the working pressure but not more than 2/5 of the bursting pressure. Company policy is to test hoses every 12 months.

Note 1: When in service, test pressure is 125% of working pressure. The working pressure of the hose should be greater than 10 bars. Keep a record of elongation suffered by the hose after testing.

Note 2: As per USCG 46CFR 153.940, the minimum bursting pressure should be 52.7 kg/cm² or 750 psi. The maximum allowable working pressure is 10.5 kg/cm² or 150 psi and cannot be greater than 1/5 of the bursting pressure.

Note 3: The IMO IBC code paragraph 2.12 allows burst pressure to be 5 times the service pressure. With a usual service pressure of no more than 120 psi (8.4 kg/cm²), this works out to 600 psi (42 kg/cm²). Remember the higher USCG requirements apply.

Permanent Markings: Each transfer hose should be permanently marked with the information required by the appropriate international standard and other applicable regulations. Information provided will include:

The manufacturer’s name or trademark.

Identification of the standard specification for manufacture.

Maximum allowable working pressure.

Month and year of manufacture and manufacturer’s serial number.

Indication that the hose is electrically continuous, electrically discontinuous, or semi-continuous.

The type of service for which it is intended, e.g., oil, product, petroleum gas.

Last hydrostatic test date and test pressure.

Any operational restrictions for use of the hose, such as minimum bend radius (MBR) or maximum flow rate.

###### Disconnection of Cargo Hoses

After the transfer of a chemical cargo is complete, minimize residues in the line, especially in the cargo hose or arm between ship and shore.

Drain the section of hose between the shore control valve and the ship's manifold before disconnecting the hoses. Drain the ship's deck and drop lines into a suitable tank to ensure that thermal expansion of the line contents cannot cause leakage through overpressure.

On completion of discharging operations at some terminals, the ship is required to clear shorelines using the following methods:

A) Use of Air:

When drained into the ship's tanks, ensure that there is sufficient ullage in the nominated tank to accept the line contents.

Air must not be used to clear lines of volatile cargoes or to clear lines into a tank containing flammable gas due to the possibility of creating a static charge.

Use air only for viscous non-volatile cargoes such as fuel oils; it must never be used on any refined white oil product or crude.

B) Use of Nitrogen:

Nitrogen may be injected into the lines to assist in clearance.

Whenever air or gas is used, the amount used should be kept to a minimum to avoid turbulence and any over-pressurization of the system.

Before disconnecting shore hoses or arms, open the shore vacuum breakers and the drain cocks at the ship's manifold. Blank off the cargo manifolds immediately after disconnection and transfer the contents of the drip tray to a suitable secure receptacle.

##### Stripping of Cargo Tanks & Stripping Results

One of the basic pieces of information contained in the P&A Manual is the so-called “Stripping results,” i.e., the quantity of cargo remaining on board in each individual cargo tank upon completion of unloading and stripping.

As per Annex II of MARPOL, quantities remaining on board in each individual cargo tank are limited as per the following table:

Note: Water is used to test the above.

For a ship other than a chemical tanker, unable to meet the above requirements for category Z products, no restriction will apply.

##### Emergency Stops

The chief officer must control the key to operate the overriding switch. The master must give permission to override any safety device or trip.

Caution: Do not override safety devices, trips, and alarms during normal operations.

Discuss the use of emergency stops during cargo operation with the terminal during the pre-transfer conference. Record the discussion in the ship/shore checklist.

In an emergency, stop the cargo pumps immediately.

Ensure all personnel involved in the cargo operations are aware of the location of cargo pump emergency stops.

Regularly test cargo pump emergency trips.

Do not override the automatic cargo pump shutdown in case of an inert gas low-pressure alarm.

Note:	The automatic shutdown prevents the cargo tanks from discharging in the event that the inert gas pressure drops below a minimum safe level.

##### Sampling

Take samples of each grade of cargo at the following points when loading:

- First Stream at the ship’s manifold

- First foot in the cargo tank

- Loaded (completed) tank

Refer to IMS Chapter 8.1.1 General Tanker Practices (Cargo Sampling).

###### Procedure and Precautions while Handling Cargo Samples

Use personal protective equipment when handling samples.

Use a special chemical-resistant outfit when handling corrosive and toxic cargoes (e.g., Caustic Soda, Phenol, Acrylonitrile). Refer to the product’s MSDS for necessary protective clothing.

When drawing toxic cargo samples, wear respiratory equipment and follow a closed sampling method in compliance with IBC Code venting and gauging regulations (IBC Ch.13 and Ch. 17).

Take samples of each grade at the ship’s manifold to check that the first stream of the incoming cargo is free of contamination.

If possible, load the smallest tank first to take the first foot sample. If any irregularity is observed, only a very small amount of cargo will be affected.

The cargo surveyor and ship’s cargo officer must take cargo samples from every loaded tank. Label and seal the samples.

Take samples in non-inerted tanks only after a sufficient “rest” period of at least 30 minutes.

Retain samples on board for 13 months or as per charterer requirements, whichever is longer, after discharging the cargo.

Keep the samples in a store within the cargo deck area, accessible from outside the accommodation. The sample room must be locked and well-ventilated.

Mark the sample containers with port, date & time, grade, MARPOL Category, and tank or manifold number. Properly seal and record all samples in the sample logbook.

Place the samples in separate cells of the box to avoid losses through movement. Construct the cell box of material resistant to the chemicals stored and stow incompatible samples away from each other.

Frequently check the samples for leakage.

Refer to IBC Code section 16.5 and the USCG compatibility chart for correct stowage of chemical samples.

Dispose of cargo samples after their retention period, provided the cargo in question is not the subject of any claim.

###### Cargo Sample Disposal

Refer to IMS Chapter 8.1.1 General Tanker Practices - Cargo Sample Disposal, in conjunction with below additional guidance.

Dispose of cargo samples as per current MARPOL regulations. Preferably, dispose of cargo samples ashore to appropriate reception facilities against a signed sample receipt.

Cargo samples of products of MARPOL Cat. X and high viscosity/solidified cargoes MARPOL Cat. Y or any cargo samples of products requiring a prewash must be landed ashore to reception facilities.

Note: Make an entry in the sample log and attach the sample receipt.

Alternatively, mix cargo samples with other slops or tank wash water of the same MARPOL category as the sample, ensuring their compatibility with reference to the USCG compatibility chart.

If the master is in any doubt about the disposal of cargo samples, seek clarification from the office.

Note: Post a copy of the disposal procedure in the cargo sample locker.

####### Inhibited Cargo Samples

Keep the inhibited cargo samples on board only for the duration of the validity of the inhibitor, as per the cargo inhibitor certificate.

Handle inhibited samples with caution and store them safely and separately in the sample locker.

Take care of the storage temperature.

Dispose of samples with inhibitors as soon as the inhibited cargo is discharged.

Do not retain on board samples with inhibitors highly sensitive to temperature variation.

###### Cargo Contamination and Cargo Samples

If there is a cargo contamination claim, the master must:

Immediately call the office and the local representative of the vessel’s P&I club.

Notify the commercial operator about the alleged claim and confirm that the P&I representative is attending.

Take care of the vessel’s sealed cargo samples, i.e., before loading sample, first foot sample before discharge sample. Do not hand them to anyone, except in agreement with the P&I representative, and only against a written receipt.

Note: The master is NOT obliged to follow any orders that go beyond the terms of the charter party.

Caution: Do not load any cargo that is not on the coating resistance list and in the certificate of fitness.

##### Cargo Operations in Compliance with FOSFA & NIOP

Internationally, 85% of global trade in oils and fats is under Federation of Oil Seeds & Fats Association (FOSFA) terms. They have about 50 banned cargoes and 110 acceptable cargoes on their list.

National Institute of Oil Seeds Production (A & B) (NIOP) and FOSFA have acceptable and banned lists of previous cargoes. The FOSFA’s lists of banned and accepted previous cargoes are presented in Appendices II and III, respectively.

When intending to load edible oils, the master must ensure records of the last three cargoes (and the relevant implemented tank cleaning method) are kept by using form CHEM-07 to document cargo tanks’ suitability. When required, complete the FOSFA Certificate of Compliance, Cleanliness, and Suitability of Ship's Tanks, as per CHEM-08, prior to loading.

FOSFA and NIOP revise their lists regularly. Ensure the latest version is available, especially if the chemical name is not found.

Other lists include EU, Procter & Gamble, and Kosher.

The EU list is stricter than FOSFA.

Procter & Gamble do not accept zinc tanks for fatty acids.

Kosher list is small and specific to Israel. For Kosher, the last 3 cargoes cannot be tallow or tallow derivative, fish oil, or wine.

Closed blisters or loose splits are not allowed in a coated cargo tank. Reduce mild steel exposure in coated tanks to a minimum. Loose rust is not permitted.

Tank cleaning solvents must be accepted as previous cargo. A written tank cleaning history will be required.

Nitric acid is a FOSFA banned chemical. BSOLVE is an NIOP banned chemical.

Styrene and EDC are banned as the last 2 cargoes in epoxy tanks. Both are banned as the last cargo in stainless steel and zinc tanks.

NIOP does not permit lead products like leaded gasoline as the last three cargoes. When carrying gasoline, ensure the lead content is documented in writing.

Follow proper sampling procedures including foot sampling of the cargo tank.

The last 3 cargoes should be at least 60% by volume of the tank if the fourth last previous cargo is banned.

Recoated cargo tanks are considered new buildings.

A statement in the form of FOSFA ‘International ship’s qualification combined Master’s certificate’ signed by Master/ Mate shall be provided for the shipper, certifying that the ship is qualified for the upcoming voyage with edible oil.

There is no difference between oils and fats; only that fats are solid at room temperatures.

Fatty acids and carboxylic acids are present in animal and vegetable oils. Most vegetable oils are mixtures of several fatty acids.

##### Chemical Compatibility Chart Notes

The accidental mixing of one chemical product with another inside a cargo tank or pipe may result in a vigorous chemical reaction.

Binary combinations that generate significant heat or produce gas can be very hazardous to personnel and property. The purpose of the Compatibility Guide is to indicate, in chart form, combinations believed to be dangerous.

Extensive use was made of direct experimental evidence obtained under contract to the NAS and Coast Guard. Specimens of compatibility charts are provided in Appendix I.

####### Definition of a Hazardous Reaction

A binary mixture is considered hazardous when the products are mixed under specified conditions and the temperature rise exceeds 25ºC or gas is evolved.

In rare cases, the reaction of two components may produce a product that is significantly more flammable or toxic than the original materials.

Although no examples of such a reaction are known at this time, they would be considered hazardous.

####### Compatibility Chart Format

In reviewing the binary test results and previous charts, it was evident that there were different degrees of reactivity among the various products. Many of them are relatively non-reactive (e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons, paraffin) while others form hazardous combinations with many groups (e.g., inorganic acids).

The compatibility chart is in two sections; groups 1 through group 22 are reactive groups and group 30 through groups 43 are cargo groups. Groups 23 through 29 and those past 43 are left unassigned and available for future expansion.

Reactive groups contain products that are chemically the most reactive; dangerous combinations may result between members of different reactive groups and between members of reactive and cargo groups.

Products assigned to cargo groups are much less reactive, and dangerous combinations can be formed only with members of certain reactive groups.

Cargo groups do not react hazardously with one another. Because of these differences in reactivity, a significant part of the usual two-dimensional chart has been eliminated.

###### Using the USCG Compatibility Guide

The following procedure explains how to use the Guide to find compatibility information:

  - Determine the group numbers of the two chemicals by referring to the alphabetical listing of products and their corresponding groups (Table 1 of 46 CFR 150).  Many chemicals are listed under their parent names and, unless otherwise indicated, isomers or mixtures of isomers for a particular product are assigned to the same group. For example, to find the group number for Isobutyl alcohol, look under the parent name Butyl alcohol. Similarly, the group number for para-Xylene is found under the entry Xylene. If a chemical cannot be found in this listing, contact the Coast Guard for a group determination.

  - If both group numbers do not fall between 30 and 43 inclusive, locate on the chart one of the numbers on the left (Cargo groups) and the other across the top (Reactive groups). Note that if one of the group numbers is between 30 and 43 it must be located on the left side.  Proceed across the page until the appropriate Reactive group column is intersected. The box formed by the intersection will indicate one of the following:

    - blank - the two products are considered compatible.

    - "X" - the two products are not considered compatible.

    - a letter other than an "X" - differences (deviations) in reactivity are present among the group members - refer to the listing following the chart to find whether the products in question are included in the deviations. Unless the combination is specifically covered on this page, it may be considered compatible.

Examples:  Combination                                       Groups        Compatible?

Butyraldehyde/Acetic Acid                    		19/4          Yes

Allyl alcohol/Toluene diisocyanate        		15/12        No

Decene/Ethylbenzene                           		30/32        Yes

Ethanolamine/Acetone                          		8/18          Yes

Ammonia/Dimethylformamide               		6/10          No

###### Exceptions to the guide

The hazard ratings in the chart are based largely upon direct experimental data using in most cases one of the most reactive members of the group.

Combinations of other group members may display considerably less reactivity.

For this reason, an experimental procedure has been developed which allows a shipper to test two particular products he believes non-hazardous although an "X" appears in the chart for their corresponding groups.

A data sheet is also supplied and should be completed and returned to the Coast Guard for evaluation. If the combination is not found to be dangerously reactive, an exception will be issued.



### 8.2.3 Personal Safety on Chemical Tankers - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Personnel Safety on Chemical Tankers

###### Introduction

Personnel handling hazardous chemicals must use protective clothing and equipment. This protective gear provides a barrier against hazards but does not reduce the hazard itself. Incorrect use or wrong type of equipment compromises its effectiveness.

The Master shall list all protective equipment required by the IBC Code and ensure availability on board, based on risk assessment and the products to be carried.

Work clothes and protective equipment should be stored in accessible places and special lockers, not within accommodation spaces, except for new or thoroughly cleaned equipment.

Defective or ineffective protective clothing or equipment fails to provide necessary safeguards. Proper care and maintenance are crucial.

Select correct items for use, keep the manufacturer’s instructions with the equipment, and refer to them as necessary. Train personnel to use equipment correctly and inform them of its limitations.

The material of suits, gloves, face shields, goggles, aprons, and other items must be suitable for the cargo. The IBC Code specifies certain protective equipment for individual cargoes.

Keep respiratory protection equipment like SCBA, CABA, and EEBD ready for use, along with basic personal protection for crew and visitors, such as safety shoes, helmets, and goggles.

Avoid contact with any chemical substance. Prevent skin and eye contact.

Use garments with leak-proof fastenings made from chemically resistant material for skin protection. Combine comfort with maximum protection.

Wash or hose down contaminated clothing before removal to extend fabric life and prevent future contamination. Store used protective clothing in a ventilated area outside the accommodation.

Use a full protective suit in areas contaminated with toxic products or where cargo vapor is toxic. Attach boots and gloves permanently. Incorporate a full face breathing mask into the suit or hood.

###### Eye Protection

Loss of eyesight is devastating. Eyes are vulnerable to corrosive and toxic liquids and vapours. Ensure proper eye protection, guided by the cargo data sheet.

Three types of eye protection:

Chemical splash goggles: Provide complete chemical and mechanical eye protection, comfortably worn over most spectacles.

Chemical spray hoods: Combined with a safety helmet, protect from liquid splashes and mechanical hazards but not vapours. Wear when disconnecting hoses at the manifold or during operations with splash risks.

Safety spectacles: Available with different lens materials and optional lateral protection. Designed to protect from dust and debris, not suitable for chemical environments.

###### Hand Protection

Hand protection is essential against hazards ranging from dust to fuming nitric acid. Select gloves based on the hazard, guided by the cargo safety data sheet (SDS), the gloves’ resistance to chemicals, and the working conditions. A wide choice of gloves can protect against hazards including corrosive chemicals, toxic chemicals that can be absorbed through the skin, and high temperature cargoes.

Types of gloves:

PVC or rubber gloves: Available in various thicknesses and weights, choice depends on the cargo.

Neoprene or nitrile rubber gloves: Excellent resistance to solvents, petrol, oils, and many chemicals.

General gloves: Preferably with long cuffs to reach over normal clothing sleeves, ensuring better protection.

###### Chemical Safety Equipment

The IBC Code mandates that chemical tankers must carry at least three complete sets of safety equipment, each allowing personnel to enter a gas-filled compartment and perform work for a minimum of 20 minutes (i.e., the limit for SCBA use).

One complete set of safety equipment shall consist of:

One self-contained air-breathing apparatus (not using stored oxygen);

Protective clothing, boots, gloves, and tight-fitting goggles.

Fireproof lifeline with a belt resistant to the cargoes carried; and

Explosion-proof lamp.

For the safety equipment required, all ships must carry either:

One set of fully charged spare air bottles for each breathing apparatus.

A special air compressor suitable for supplying high-pressure air of the required purity.

A charging manifold capable of handling sufficient spare air bottles for the breathing apparatus; or

Fully charged spare air bottles with a total free air capacity of at least 6,000 litres for each breathing apparatus on board, exceeding the requirements of SOLAS regulation II-2/10.10.

The sets of safety equipment must be kept in suitable, clearly marked, and easily accessible places. The breathing apparatus must be inspected and tested at least once a month by a responsible officer, with the inspection recorded in the ship’s logbook.

Additionally, the equipment must be inspected and tested by an expert at least once a year.

Note: In this context, an “expert” can be an approved shore service provider, or a crewmember trained by the manufacturer (valid for 5 years).

When carrying toxic cargoes, the safety equipment mentioned above should provide full protection. The protective suits must offer adequate protection against the product as indicated in the appropriate resistance table provided by the manufacturer and be fitted with integral gloves and boots.

The hazmat suit can be used for up to two hours of work, depending on the type of work, allowing the worker to decontaminate and take breaks frequently.

The responsible officer should be aware of these limitations as they relate to the cargoes being carried. Such protective suits are not required if the vessel does not carry toxic cargoes.

###### Foot Protection

Wear rubber or PVC boots when there is a risk of coming into contact with corrosive or toxic chemicals. Boots with reinforced toe caps are preferable as they also provide protection against solid objects.

###### Decontamination Showers

Vessels carrying cargoes listed in IGC Code Chapter 19, column “I” (i.e., chemical tankers) must be equipped with one or more decontamination showers and eyewash stations on deck. The showers must be:

Suitably marked

Easily accessible

Regularly inspected and tested

They should be operational in any ambient condition. For this purpose, a recirculation system or a heat trace line should be available to prevent freezing. Additionally, thermal insulation may be provided to freshwater pipes, and it should be maintained in good order.

Caution: Uninsulated sections of freshwater supply lines may lead to water being heated by direct sunlight, rendering the shower or eyewash station unusable for the intended purpose.

Before arrival at ports and before commencing any tank cleaning or gas-freeing operation, the system must be verified to ensure that decontamination showers and eyewash stations are ready for use.

Caution: For the eyewash, avoid excessive or low pressure in the system. The water pressure should be adjusted to ensure that the two jets of water are barely intersecting.

###### Medical Tests

All personnel employed on chemical vessels must undergo regular blood tests to ascertain normal red and white blood cell counts.

In case of accidental physical contact with chemical cargoes, a blood test must be carried out at the next convenient port. Copy all such medical reports to REEDEREI NORD. The costs of such tests will be reimbursed through normal expense claims.

Note: Personnel serving on chemical tankers are required to undergo this test each leave and will not be considered available to join any vessel without producing a satisfactory medical report to the office.

###### Health Hazards

####### Toxicity

Toxicity is the ability of a substance, when inhaled, ingested, or absorbed by skin, to cause damage to living tissue, impairment of the central nervous system, severe illness, or death. "Toxic" is synonymous with "poisonous."

Acute poisoning occurs when a large dose is received by exposure to high concentrations for a short duration. Chronic poisoning occurs through exposure to low concentrations over a long period. Toxicity is evaluated based on test dosages under controlled conditions and expressed as threshold limit values (TLV).

####### Asphyxia

Asphyxia is unconsciousness caused by a lack of oxygen, resulting in suffocation. Any vapor may cause asphyxiation by excluding oxygen in the air. Oxygen-deficient atmospheres can also occur through natural causes, such as the decomposition or putrefaction of organic cargo or the rusting of steel.

####### Anaesthesia

Certain vapours cause loss of consciousness due to their effect on the nervous system. Additionally, anaesthetic vapours may or may not be toxic.

###### Medical First Aid

The “Medical First Aid Guide for Use in Accidents Involving Dangerous Goods” (MFAG) Appendix 4 contains advice for recognizing and treating chemical poisoning within the limits of the facilities on board.

During the handling of toxic cargo, any person who shows symptoms of poisoning shall be treated as per the MFAG, followed by a doctor visit.

During operations involving toxic or corrosive cargo, keep the required antidotes ready for immediate use in the cargo control room. Ships carrying dangerous goods have additional medicines, specific antidotes, and special equipment on board as prescribed in the IMO’s Medical First Aid Guide for Use in Accidents Involving Dangerous Goods (MFAG).

The list of medicines and equipment required by IMO can be found in the Supplement to the IMDG Code Chapter MFAG Appendix 14.

###### Safety Information for Shore Personnel

Be aware that most persons coming on board are not familiar with the hazards of chemical tanker operations or the actions to take in an emergency. Even specialized personnel boarding the ship for cargo-related issues (such as cargo surveyors) may not be familiar with other products being handled at the same time.

Therefore, provide all persons, including contractors and sub-contractors boarding the ship, with an overview of the hazards present and the safety precautions to observe while they are on board. This advice should include:

Products being handled while they are on board

Details of restricted and permitted areas

What to do if the emergency alarm sounds

What to do and where to go if contamination with chemicals occurs

What to do if involved in an accident on board

We recommend that the advice is presented in written format and handed to each visitor upon boarding the ship.

Similar advice should be provided to those working close to the vessel, such as the crews of barges (bunkers, stores) and personnel working near the ship's side. This is especially relevant if cargo operations or gas freeing operations are taking place, which can spread cargo vapors over a large area.

Prior to commencing sweeping operations, brief the crew on the dangers involved. The following guidelines should be followed:

An experienced person should be appointed as the leader of the sweeping team. Their role will be to coordinate the work and ensure the safety and welfare of the team.

The team leader should be able to communicate effectively with the person stationed at the entrance to the tank.

All team members should be encouraged to look out for the well-being of their fellow team members.

If at any time a person finds it hard to breathe or feels unwell due to the heat or any other cause, they should alert the team leader, who will raise the alarm. The person should vacate the space as soon as possible by whatever means is practical in the circumstances.

Proper PPE should be worn.

###### Outside Contractors

It is common practice for contractors and sub-contractors to work on chemical tankers, particularly during cargo operations and tank cleaning.

The safety of the shore personnel while on board rests with the ship. If there is any doubt about an individual's fitness to work on board, they should not be allowed to engage in any work.

Make the contractors and sub-contractors aware of the ship's safety policies, procedures, and work practices, including the company's enclosed space entry procedures. They should comply with these procedures.

Confirm that contractors are aware of the particular risks and dangers associated with their work on board and that they know the actions to take in an emergency. Ensure that the contractors and sub-contractors use PPE appropriate for the intended work on board the ship.

### 8.2.4 Handling Instructions for Specific Cargoes - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Handling Instructions for Specific Cargoes

###### Introduction

Noxious liquid substances may have one or more hazard properties, including flammability, toxicity, corrosiveness, and reactivity, as well as environmental hazards if accidentally released. The IBC Code provides an index of such relevant substances.

The IBC Code categorizes substances with respect to hazards and precautions. Substances requiring special treatment, in addition to the Code's requirements, are listed in the IBC Code under "Special requirements."

These substances include:

Acetone cyanohydrin and lactonitrile solution

Ammonium nitrate solution (93% or less)

Carbon disulphide

Diethyl ether

Hydrogen peroxide solutions

Motor fuel anti-knock compounds

Phosphorus, yellow or white

Propylene oxide and mixtures of ethylene oxide/propylene oxide with an ethylene oxide content of not more than 30% by weight

Sodium chlorate solution (50% or less)

Sulphur (molten)

Acids

Toxic products

Cargoes protected by additives

Cargoes with vapour pressure greater than 1.013 bar absolute at 37.8°C

Alkyl (C7 - C9) nitrates, all isomers

###### Guidelines for the Transport and Storage of Bio-Fuels, Edible Oils, and Fats

The following are requirements/guidelines for vessels loading vegetable oil. Note that this list is not exhaustive and should be supplemented by safe seamanship practices, relevant regulations, and shipping industry standards.

Bio-fuels include ethyl alcohol, fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), vegetable oils (triglycerides), and alkanes (C10-C26), linear and branched, with a flashpoint either below or above 60°C, as identified in chapters 17 and 18 of the IBC Code or the MEPC.2/Circular/tripartite agreements.

##### General Handling Instructions

###### Prior to Loading:

Ensure cargo tanks and hoses are dry, clean, and ready for loading and surveyor inspection. Pressure test cargo, COW, and ballast pipelines and flexible hoses, especially before loading sensitive, toxic, or flammable cargoes. Record relevant notices in the pre-arrival checklist.

Pressure test heating coils before arrival at the loading port and record entries in the bridge logbook.

Remove any anodes fitted in tanks before loading.

Blank off the IGS (if fitted) line.

Store and lock gauge floaters during loading, discharging, and cleaning cargo tanks for vegetable oils.

Load vegetable oils using independent drop lines or hoses through Butterworth openings. Avoid using the vessel's permanent piping unless special circumstances dictate.

For certain cargoes, charterers may request a nitrogen (N2) blanket. For tanks using nitrogen blankets, seal all openings with silicon to prevent nitrogen gas escape and air/moisture ingress.

Ensure the coating has no rust and that all blisters are broken to avoid contamination. Consult the coating resistance list.

Certain cargoes require pre-shipment analysis. Instructions will be provided by the office or charterers.

Zinc coatings may pose a threat when stowing "crude" vegetable oils (e.g., CPO, CNO) or fatty acid oil. Consult with the office beforehand. Restrictions may also apply to refined vegetable oils.

####### Documentation:

A tentative stowage plan should be available and distributed to surveyors/shippers upon request, with receipt confirmation documented. Parcel number, grade, and quantity should be clearly indicated.

The Tightness Certificate, signed by the Master and Chief Engineer, should confirm that heating coils were tested with no leaks, clearly indicating the date and pressure.

Heating instructions should be received from the shipper or their appointed cargo surveyor, indicating temperatures for loading, transport, and discharging. These instructions are provided by I.A.S.C. (International Association of Seed Crushers) through the cargo surveyor.

Cargo surveyors will provide a density/temperature correction factor chart. This form should be signed by the surveyor.

If the cargo is acceptable for the coating, an original signed copy of the analysis will be given to the Master.

Request in writing that all parcels (where applicable) are loaded simultaneously.

####### During Loading:

Closely monitor cargo temperature. Record average temperature readings taken at three levels (bottom, middle, top). If the temperature exceeds the allowable limit, issue a Letter of Protest for overheating, signed by relevant parties.

Use stainless steel portable thermometers (not copper/brass/bronze) and avoid leaving them inside tanks continuously.

Certain cargoes (e.g., CPO, PFAD) foam during loading, making accurate ullage readings difficult. Manual "floaters" gauge performs better than a manual gauge with an attached weight when foaming occurs.

Since oils are loaded through deck openings using hoses, splashing may occur. To avoid splashing when loading drying or semi-drying oils and when adjacent tanks are heated, lower the hose into the tank. Certain ports require the hose to be lowered into the tank regardless of the cargo and periodically lifted to remain just above the cargo surface.\

####### During Carriage:

Strictly follow heating instructions:

Maintain temperature within the specified minimum and maximum limits.

Do not exceed a temperature increase of 5°C within 24 hours.

Keep the top and bottom temperature difference within 5°C.

Caution: For heated cargoes, moisture development (e.g., if the cargo tank is not properly sealed) can increase Free Fatty Acid (FFA) content, which can harm the cargo tank coating and the cargo itself.

####### Upon Discharging:

Constantly monitor cargo condition and fluidity. Depending on circumstances, cargo re-circulation or washing using small Butterworth hoses might be required to remove cargo from internal surfaces.

Sampling

Types of Samples:

Line sample

First foot sample

Intermediate sample

Final sample

Sampling by the surveyor should always be witnessed by a deck officer. Applicable sampling guidelines are presented in a previous paragraph of this manual. Internal cargo transfer is not allowed without charterers' authorization, unless safety reasons necessitate it.

##### Handling of Specific Cargoes

###### Introduction

Toxic products must never mix with edible products for human or cattle consumption. Even minor leakage between tanks could be fatal. Piping systems should be entirely segregated or provided with double blind flanges.

Both the Federation of Oils, Seeds, and Fats Associations (FOSFA) and the National Institute of Oilseed Products (NIOP) publish lists of banned cargoes, which would prevent a vessel from loading edible oil or fat. The latest FOSFA lists of banned and acceptable cargoes are attached in Appendices II and III of this manual. Cleaning from chemicals to FOSFA or NIOP standards is required.

###### Vegetable, Animal, and Fish Oils:

Preparation: For edible vegetable oils such as Soybean, Rapeseed, Coconut, and Palm oils, tanks, pipelines, and pumps must be scrupulously clean. The last three cargoes must have been lead-free. The same applies to pipelines and pumps. Special cleaning instructions, often involving chemicals, will be issued to vessels programmed to load these cargoes.

Vessels with Aluminium/Brass heating coils are unsuitable for Palm Oil.

Coconut and Palm oil require heating to approximately 45°C.

Rapeseed oil may require heating to about 27°C.

Soybean oil does not require heating until the cargo temperature falls below about 10°C.

Density: All the above oils have a density of approximately 0.9.

Draining: To drain the tanks, the oil is squeezed to the suctions. The Master is responsible for arranging labor for this operation.

###### Vegetable / Palm Oils

High Melting Point (MP) Oils: High MP oils like palmitic acid, stearic acid, and fatty acids must never be allowed to freeze in the cargo pipelines. Discharging high MP oils in cold weather requires a clear action plan, especially during barge changeover and efficient sweeping. Cargo inside the pipelines must be immediately blown downhill before it freezes. Sweeping high MP oils at high discharge temperatures requires close supervision. Sweeping equipment and waders must be ready, and a tank dry surveyor must be available to declare when the task is complete. Once the cargo falls below the level of steam coils, actions must be accelerated to prevent solidification.

Pre-arrival Heating: Ensure that solidifying products are at the maximum discharge temperature (or slightly above) at least one week before arrival at the discharge berth. During this period, sound each tank with a rod and line to check for solid product on the tank bottom.

Ballast Management: Lower any ballast in double bottom tanks beneath the cargo tanks to avoid direct contact between the ballast and the cargo in adjacent tanks. If there is a suction pit under the impeller of the deep well pump, ensure it is not stuck. The pit may need to be steamed from underneath.

####### Palm Oil Types Abbreviations:

CPO: Crude palm oil

NPO: Neutralized palm oil

B: Bleached

RD: Refined, deodorized

L: Olein

S: Stearin

A: Acid

FD: Fatty distillate

K: Kernel

LC: Low color

DF: Double fractionated

ME: Methyl ester

IV: Iodine value

PU: Poly unsaturated

Temperature Rise: Sudden temperature increases in palm oils due to indiscriminate heating can trigger fire-fighting appliances and make the cargo off-specification.

Acid Value (AV): The number of grams of KOH required to neutralize 1 kg of product.

Free Fatty Acidity (FFA): AV is generally twice the FFA number.

Fatty Acids: Aliphatic (oleic, palmitic, stearic), Aromatic (phenyl stearic), Amino acids.

####### Heating Requirements

Internationally recognized heating instructions for various products should be followed.

The product should reach the maximum indicated temperature at least seven days before arrival. Shippers will provide specific heating requirements for voyage heat and discharge heat.

The applicable MSDS sheet and International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code should be consulted prior to any loading and carriage.

###### Tallow / Grease / Animal Fats

These products, mainly from beef cattle but also from sheep, goats, and pigs, are animal body fats. Only the top-quality tallow classified as edible is used for food.

It is produced using either low temperatures (around 60°C) in open pans or higher temperatures in enclosed systems, but only the best quality raw material will yield the best quality tallow.

The upper portion of the molten fat, the premier jus (or ‘first juice’), yields quality dripping. Poorer quality tallows, containing higher proportions of free fatty acids, are used for industrial purposes.

####### Deterioration Causes

Three types of deterioration can occur in tallows and fats during storage and transportation:

Oxidation: Contact with oxygen causes chemical changes that downgrade the product quality.

Hydrolysis: The breakdown of fats to fatty acids is promoted by the presence of water, especially at higher temperatures, and by certain microorganisms. Tanks should always be clean and dry before use.

Contamination: Contamination can occur from residues of previous materials, dirt, rain, seawater, or accidental addition of a different product. Ensuring cleanliness of valves and pipelines, especially where common for different tanks, is crucial.

The susceptibility of tallows to deterioration depends on factors such as the type of oil or fat, its state (crude, partially, or fully refined), and the presence of impurities. These factors should be considered when storing and transporting the product.

####### Storage and Transportation

Coatings: For bulk transport, tallows are shipped in coated tanks to prevent corrosion of the mild steel. The coating should be approved for contact with food. Stainless steel tanks do not require coatings.

Maintenance: Inspect tanks before loading to ensure coatings are intact. Repairs should be made as necessary.

Temperature Control: Maintain cargo temperature between 55°C - 65°C during loading/discharging to prevent crystallization and solidification. In cold weather, maintain discharge temperatures at the upper range to prevent pipeline blockages. During sea passage, keep the temperature between 45°C - 55°C.

Heating Facilities: Install heating facilities for solid, semi-solid, and high viscosity tallows and fats to ensure the product is liquid and homogeneous during transfer or unloading. Use stainless steel heating coils, as copper alloys are unsuitable.

Pipelines: Design pipelines to avoid admixture with air. Use bottom filling or top filling with pipes leading near the bottom to prevent aeration. Clear pipelines using a “pigging” system or inert gas. If air is used, ensure it is not blown into the oil in the tanks.

Inert Gas Blanketing: Use inert gas blanketing for high-quality products or long storage periods.

MSDS and IMDG Code: Consult the applicable MSDS sheet and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code prior to loading and carriage.

FAME can be produced from various vegetable oils (e.g., soya beans, palm oils), so temperatures for loading, transit, and discharge will vary and should be requested from the shipper before loading.

For international voyages, tanks should be blanketed to 5% oxygen content to reduce moisture. For EU inland waterways, North Sea, and UK voyages, a nitrogen blanket is not required.

####### Tank Requirements

Cleanliness: Ensure all shore and ship cargo lines and tanks are clean, dry, odor-free, and rust-free, with good gaskets and pressure-tested heating coils. Blow heating coils clear with nitrogen.

Coating Verification: Verify that tank coatings are suitable for the product. Zinc coating and some epoxies are not resistant, so acid values should be checked. Wall wash tests are not required.

MSDS and IMDG Code: Consult the applicable MSDS sheet and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code prior to loading and carriage.

###### Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) (ALKANES C10-C26)

The applicable MSDS sheet and International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code should be consulted prior to any loading and carriage.

###### Ethyl Alcohol (Ethanol)

Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, is produced both as a petrochemical through the hydration of ethylene and via biological processes by fermenting sugars with yeast.

The more economical process depends on the prevailing prices of petroleum and grain feed stocks.

Ethanol is a clear, colourless liquid and an inflammable, slightly toxic compound with a distinct odour.

Fuel-grade ethanol is blended with gasoline, forming a "finished" motor oil product.

Ethanol is the pivotal ingredient in alcoholic drinks and is also produced for industrial purposes, often used as a clean-burning biofuel.

Note: Ethanol can be adulterated with methyl alcohol (methanol), which is dangerous to consume as it can lead to blindness and other severe symptoms, including acidosis and potentially death by respiratory failure.

Production for Industrial Use: Ethanol used as an industrial feedstock or solvent is often made from petrochemical feed stocks via the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene (C₂H₄ + H₂O → CH₃CH₂OH), using phosphoric acid as a catalyst at 300°C with high pressure steam.

Storage and Transportation: An ethanol-water solution containing 40% ABV will catch fire if heated to about 26 °C and an ignition source is applied. The flash point of pure ethanol is 16.60 °C. Ethanol should be stored segregated at temperatures not exceeding 23°C and safeguarded from all possible sources of ignition. The applicable MSDS sheet and International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code should be consulted prior to any loading and carriage.

###### Palm Fatty Distillate (PFAD)

Prior to accepting Palm Fatty Distillate (PFAD) for shipment, a pre-shipment sampling analysis must be carried out.

When a parcel of PFAD is offered for shipment, a certified laboratory is ordered to analyze a sample. The results are sent to the Company, and if within limits, approval for shipment is passed to the Master along with the analysis report.

The Master must ensure receipt of the analysis, original certificate, and Company approval before loading. Cargo samples must be taken as per Cargo Sampling guidelines.

PFAD is accepted for shipment only in cargo tanks coated with Sigma Phenguard or equivalent coating.

###### Bio-Fuel Blends

Bio-fuel blends are mixtures resulting from blending bio-fuels identified at 12.31 with petroleum oil.

The carriage of bio-fuel blends must comply with Annex 11 of the MEPC.2/Circular. Blends containing 75% or more petroleum oil are subject to Annex I of MARPOL. Blends with more than 1% but less than 75% petroleum oil are subject to Annex II of MARPOL and should be carried under conditions detailed in MEPC.1/Circ.761/Rev.1.

Summary of Minimum Requirements on Bio-Fuel Blends (MEPC.1/Circ.761/Rev.1):

Table 1: Details the summary of minimum requirements.

(columns numbered as per Ch.17 of the IBC Code)

With respect to new bio-fuels identified as falling under the scope of these guidelines, carriage requirements for specific bio-fuel/petroleum oil blends to be shipped as MARPOL Annex II cargoes will be incorporated into List 1 of the MEPC.2/Circular, as appropriate.

When containing 1% or less of petroleum oil, the bio-fuel blends are subject to Annex II of MARPOL.

The following table presents the regulatory requirements for carriage of Bio-Fuel Blends according to the petroleum oil contents

Invert (upside-down) super forated protective pipe and blank opening with stainless steel (SUS) 1.5 mm plate with rubber gasket.

Ensure all material in contact with latex is stainless steel. If any rust spots are found inside the tank, passivate locally.

Ensure tank tightness to avoid ingress of air/humidity and leakage of cargo (cargo will be loaded to approximately 100% capacity).

####### Carriage Instructions

The water spray system should be checked and used when passing through warm climates (do not exceed the required carriage temperature).

Portable pumps, provided by contractors, will be used to discharge. These pumps will be lowered into the tank through the aft-most tank opening.

At the last stage of discharge, the portable pump should be relocated near the cargo well, and the remaining cargo should be swept towards the pump section using squeegees. Comply with procedures for entry into enclosed spaces.

Check protective equipment (SCBA clothing, boots, gloves, etc.) prior to use and wear them while working inside the tank.

####### Cleaning

Upon discharge, tanks should be cleaned immediately with fresh water for 90 minutes. Upon completion, remove "washing" from the tank using the "siphon/ejector" principle.

####### Required Materials and Equipment

###### Propylene Oxide

Hoses used for the transfer of Propylene Oxide must be marked ‘For Alkylene Oxide Transfer Only’ in accordance with the IBC Code.

Set the P/V valves and tank lids for the carriage of Propylene Oxide conditions, if possible.

All adjacent spaces should either be loaded with a compatible cargo or fully inerted.

Cargoes like Propylene Oxide are very sensitive and require pre-purging of the cargo tank. The maximum oxygen limit is usually 50 ppm (0.005% O2) to a maximum of 1,000 ppm (0.1% O2).

If more than one tank is to be purged, use a cascade system of purging whenever possible, unless the supply pressure of Nitrogen is too high for safe execution (e.g., at Richards Bay, South Africa).

Use special tank cleaning procedures for cleaning Propylene Oxide tanks, adhering to the instructions of the charterer and the Miracle Tank Cleaning Guide.

###### Petrochemicals

The grades under this category are numerous with varying characteristics. It is impossible to provide precise instructions under a general heading.

Except for those Chemical Feedstocks covered in the Tank Cleaning Tables, tanks must be specially cleaned before loading unless a special preliminary cargo has been carried.

Ships not specifically chartered for this trade will receive special instructions whenever such grades are to be loaded.

Chemicals are made to rigid specifications and are useless if contaminated. They cannot be re-distilled or re-treated in standard plants, nor blended with 'on specification' material.

Chemicals are highly sensitive to water contamination and traces of grease, oil, or rust inside the tank. Contamination can also occur from contact with containers or pipes previously containing leaded products or other incompatible substances.

###### Carriage of Bitumen (Carried in Specialized Tankers)

####### Introduction

Bitumen is normally carried in the center tanks of specially designed ships. Due to its high viscosity, it must be handled at higher temperatures than other Black Oils.

While normal loading temperatures range between 110°C and 150°C, loading temperatures may occasionally reach up to 180°C to meet terminal requirements. However, it is inadvisable to exceed 160°C unless special instructions are given by Charterers.

Bitumen must be maintained at a high temperature during transit, as it is difficult to bring back to a pumpable state from cold.

The aim is to have the cargo at the required temperature upon arrival at the discharge port, with minimal steam (and boiler fuel) usage during the voyage.

On short voyages, the cargo should be maintained within easy reach of the discharge temperature.

####### Ballast Tanks and System:

Ballast in Bitumen ships is normally carried only in wing tanks. The ballast system must be entirely separate from the center cargo tank system to prevent contact with Bitumen.

With all ballast tanks filled, and carrying a normal amount of bunkers, stores, and water, such ships will be approximately half-loaded, suitable for most weather conditions.

If necessary to load ballast into tanks later used for Bitumen, ensure all water is removed before loading, and inform Charterers.

Occasionally, deeper drafts may be required for canal transit. The Company will provide special instructions in such cases.

Test the complete heating coil system for water tightness on each ballast voyage to ensure all sections are in good order. Also, test steam jacketed cargo suction lines and underdeck lines.

####### Loading

As already mentioned, water must never be allowed to contaminate the bitumen as steam would be generated, causing frothing of the cargo.

Bitumen tanks are frequently required to carry cargoes other than bitumen. When this is required, the necessary cleaning is clearly set out. However, when reloading bitumen, the cleaning requirements are not as specific. The following paragraphs provide guidance on the procedures necessary, depending on the previous cargo.

####### Tank Preparation and Loading Procedures

Previous Cargo: Bitumen or Fuel Oil with a Flashpoint of 66°C or Above (Free of Water)

If the tanks have been well drained, the ship should be ready to load immediately after de-ballasting. Any condensation present in cargo tanks should be evaporated using the steam coils prior to arrival.

Previous Cargo: Crude Oil or Fuel Oil Containing More Than 1% Water or Having a Flashpoint Below 66°C

A wash with fuel oil is necessary. Experience has shown that this operation should not take more than 12-15 hours after de-ballasting. In case of low flashpoint, crude tanks should be cleared of gas prior to the product flush. When reloading at the same port, an additional 12 hours can be considered appropriate.

Exceptional Circumstances:

By mutual agreement with the loading terminal, an asphalt wash may be necessary, either with or without a previous fuel oil wash. Such a wash should be considered the exception rather than the rule.

Note: Whenever water deposits (other than condensation) are present in the tanks due to coil or tank leakage, steam should be admitted to the bottom coils about 8 hours prior to loading, with the tank lids in the half-open position. At the same time, steam should be admitted to the upper deck loading lines and the loading and discharge lines on deck. When the bitumen in them has liquefied and the valves are free to operate, the loading master valves and the loading valve for the first tank to be filled should be opened to relieve any pressure produced by expansion of the vapour.

Whenever cargo tanks are pre-heated, the tank atmosphere should be monitored at least once every four hours. If an explosimeter reading greater than 50% LEL is obtained, heating should stop, and the tanks ventilated until less than 10% LEL is achieved. Heating may then be resumed.

When notice to commence loading is given, the steam to the tanks to be loaded first should be shut off. A similar procedure should be followed with each tank to be loaded, but steam should not be shut off to the suction and loading lines until the complete cargo is loaded.

Cargo suction line valves should not be closed too tightly prior to loading, as they are liable to jam due to expansion when hot bitumen contacts them. For this reason, suction lines should be thoroughly heated.

Due to the high temperature at which bitumen cargoes are loaded and the possibility of temperature changes reducing the grip of the clamps, shore flexible hoses should always be connected to the ship's pipeline by bolts.

####### Laden Passage

Pay due regard to the temperatures and other conditions likely to be experienced towards the end of the passage. On a long voyage, when a mean temperature of 105°C has been maintained at sea, at least seven days should be allowed before arrival at the discharging port to raise the cargo to the desired discharging temperature.

Use the centre/side coils until about 2-3 days prior to arrival at port, then substitute the bottom coils with the side coils as needed. The temperature registered on the bottom thermometer is a good guide for when to bring the bottom coils into use.

Except for tankers with combined double bottom and wing tanks, the greatest heat losses at sea occur through the bottom shell, which is in direct contact with the heated bitumen on one side and seawater on the other. Maintaining a layer of semi-plastic bitumen, a good insulator, over the bottom of the tank can considerably save heat loss. Use only the centre/side sections of coils at sea to achieve this.

To minimize heat losses through the deck, load the cargo so that the liquid surface in any tank is below the lower edge of the deck longitudinal, provided this can be done without incurring dead freight.

To suppress foaming caused by water in a cargo of bitumen, the vessel should carry a minimum of three 4.55-liter (3-gallon) cans of Silicone Oil S.115 stowed in an accessible place. Silicone oil is a low viscosity oil that runs freely and is insoluble in bitumen. Pour the oil in small quantities into the cargo tanks until foaming stops or is controlled. The quantity required to suppress foaming is approximately a concentration of 2 ppm or 0.57 liters (1 pint) per 250 tons of cargo.

Note: Silicone oil can contaminate certain grades of bitumen. Use it only in an emergency to control serious foaming and use the minimum necessary. This particularly applies to Roofing Flux (ARF) and Culvert Coating Flux (CCF), which may then have to be downgraded to fuel oil or returned to the loading port.

####### Discharging

Before arrival at the discharging port, clear and thoroughly heat the heating system on cargo pumps, under-deck delivery, and suction lines (if the latter have not been in use for heating purposes).

If it is known which tank will be discharged first, circulate the contents of this tank by drawing from the suction and delivering back through the under-deck line valve into the tank.

When discharging cargo, it should only be necessary to use the bottom coils, as the peak temperature should have been reached before arrival.

When pumping begins, watch the pressure gauge carefully. Shore lines have been known to be wholly or partially blocked by solidified bitumen. As a precautionary measure, maintain circulation until the shoreline is proved clear. Gradually close the tank filling valve until a pressure of about 3.5 kg/sq cm is registered on the discharging gauge. When the shore line is opened, a drop in pressure will indicate that the line is clear, whereupon the tank filling valve may be closed. If the line is only partially blocked, experience shows it soon thaws clear when hot bitumen passes through it.

The cargo receiver will indicate the maximum permissible pressure on the flexible hose and shore pipeline.

####### Draining

To ensure effective draining, leave about 40 cm (15 inches) of cargo in the tanks. This amount will be sufficient to cover the lowest thermometer and the bottom section of the heating coils.

If this balance of cargo is heated for about an hour, most of the bitumen will have drained from the bulkheads, and its temperature will be sufficiently high to ensure quick discharge with minimal bitumen remaining. Draining should be done quickly, as bitumen soon loses fluidity once it leaves the heating coils.

Although a high temperature is necessary to discharge most of the cargo at a satisfactory rate, draining may be unduly prolonged if the temperature is too high due to bitumen vaporizing and gassing the cargo pumps. The right temperature in any particular ship can only be determined by experience.

As cargo pump suctions may become intermittently uncovered and draw air during draining, provision must be made for priming. Generally, retain a priming head in one of the tanks until all remaining tanks have been thoroughly drained.

##### Miscellaneous grades

Refer also to IMS Chapter 8.1. – Oil when handling Marpol Annex I Cargoes.

In addition, refer also to below guidance, as applicable.

###### Aromatic solvents (Super Benzex, White Spirits, SBPs etc.)

Tankers are sometimes required to load parcels of these products. They contain a very high percentage of aromatics, which are excellent solvents for asphalted matter. Consequently, they may be readily downgraded if tanks and pipelines contain any trace of black oil products.

No such risk is incurred if the ship has always been in the white oil trade, carrying cargoes such as gasoline. However, in ships on black oil service, the internal surfaces of the cargo pipelines become impregnated with oil, oxidized oil, and asphalted matter. On conversion to the white oil trade, these residues are removed to a degree dependent on the solvent action of normal white oil products.

Although the ship may have successfully carried ordinary white oil products since black oil trading, these solvents, especially Super Benzex, are much more powerful and can still extract residues that do not contaminate normal 'clean' grades. Even after thirty to forty days following the changeover from black oil trading, 'clean' grades may suffer color deterioration. This should be considered when a chemical vessel is committed to black oil trading.

Whenever aromatic solvents are first carried after black oil trading, the tanks and pipelines to be used should be thoroughly washed. Additionally, the system should be flushed with approximately 35 tonnes of the solvent to be loaded. This should then be discharged ashore for downgrading if laboratory tests prove it necessary.

As an additional precaution, approximately 60 cm (2 feet) of the solvent should be loaded into tanks and tested for quality before normal loading commences.

###### Aviation Turbine Fuels (ATF)

These can be roughly divided into two classes:

Avtag (JP4): Gasoline base with a flash point below 23°C.

Avtur, Jet A-1, Dual Purpose Kerosene, and Avcat (JP5): Kerosene base with a flash point above 38°C.

The division has been considered in the White Oil Tank Cleaning Table and should be borne in mind when handling and stowing these grades with other multi-grade white oils.

Quality requirements for aviation turbine fuels are stringent. It is becoming increasingly difficult for ships to maintain the required degree of cleanliness. Particulate matter, such as small rust particles, are serious contaminants, and this is more easily controlled in ships with painted tanks.

Because of increasing quality requirements and occasional special contracts requiring ships' tanks to be cleaned to the satisfaction of an inspector appointed by the cargo receivers, additional tank cleaning may sometimes be necessary. In such cases, the company should provide further advice to the vessel accordingly.

The presence of water in cargo is always undesirable, but this is particularly critical for aviation turbine fuels (ATF). It is important that tanks, pumps, and pipelines be thoroughly drained of water and tanks mopped dry before loading commences.

Frequently, both before and after completing the discharge of parcels of ATF, ships are asked by the "shore" to pump water to clear the shore pipelines. Ships will then be left with pumps and pipelines full of water, which should be drained back to an empty tank before further discharge of ATF is undertaken. This is crucial as the next port of call may not have alternative storage available and may be unable to cope with a water slug.

###### Sour Naphtha and Aviation Fuels

Naphtha is "sour" if its mercaptan level is greater than 100 ppm and H₂S level greater than 10 ppm. Charterers are not always able to determine if a naphtha is sweet or sour. Aviation fuels must not be loaded after a "sour" cargo.

Masters must advise charterers of the mercaptan and H₂S levels when instructed to load aviation fuels after a cargo of naphtha.

After the carriage of any "sour" cargo, contamination to aviation fuel can still occur even after a barrier cargo. Machine washing of cargo tanks does not remove H₂S, mercaptan, or corrosive sulfur compounds from internal steelwork, particularly from unpainted steelwork.

###### Carbon Black Feedstock

These feedstocks are usually carried with crude or other black products or feedstocks (although occasionally full cargoes are arranged) and delivered directly to customers. They are extremely sensitive to water contamination, especially salt water. Consequently, all reasonable precautions must be taken when preparing tanks and during loading, carriage, and discharge to guard against water contamination, especially salt.

The density of carbon black feedstock is slightly above 1.0. Water, instead of settling out, is more likely to emulsify and come to the top, aggravating the problem with this feedstock.

As soon as loading orders are received, choose the most suitable tanks, considering the need for positive segregation and susceptibility to water contamination. Fully test the heating coils and rectify any deficiencies before heating commences. In the event of suspected coil leakage during passage, inform charterers immediately of the tank concerned and the amount of cargo involved.

Every endeavor should be made to select tanks that previously contained a product for which no tank cleaning is necessary. This avoids the introduction of salt water into the tanks. If this is impractical, or if the tanks have already been washed before receiving the loading instructions, advise charterers and the loading terminal so that further anti-salt precautions may be considered. These may involve product or fresh water flushing of tanks and/or lines.

Ensure that tanks, pipelines, and pumps are well drained and that no water pockets remain.

###### Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE)

Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is an organic compound that is a volatile, flammable, and colourless liquid immiscible with water.

It has a minty odour vaguely reminiscent of diethyl ether, leading to an unpleasant taste and odour in water.

MTBE is a gasoline additive used as an oxygenate to raise the octane number. Its use is controversial in the US and declining in part because of its occurrence in groundwater and legislation favouring ethanol.

Worldwide production of MTBE has remained constant at about 18 million tons/year (2005) owing to growth in Asian markets which are less subject to ethanol subsidies.

MTBE is manufactured via the chemical reaction of methanol and isobutylene. Methanol is derived from natural gas and isobutylene from butane obtained from crude oil or natural gas. In the United States, it was produced in very large quantities (more than 200,000 barrels per day in 1999) during its use as a fuel additive.

As a solvent, MTBE has one distinct advantage over most ethers: it has a reduced tendency to form explosive organic peroxides.

Opened bottles of diethyl ether or THF can build up dangerous levels of these peroxides in months, whereas samples of MTBE are usually safe for years (though they should still be tested periodically). For this reason (as well as its higher boiling point), MTBE is used extensively as a solvent in industry, where safety concerns and regulations make working with diethyl ether, THF, or other ethers more difficult and expensive. Despite its popularity in industrial settings, it is rarely used as a solvent in academia with some exceptions.

###### Urea-ammonium Nitrate (UAN)

This is a high-performance liquid nitrogen fertilizer with a controllable nutrient content that has optional variations from 28% to 32%. Its chemical formula is (NH₂)₂CO + NH₄NO₃ + H₂O. UAN is produced by mixing water solutions of urea and ammonium nitrate in certain percentages. Then, free ammonia is neutralized with nitric acid and a rust-preventing agent is added to the mixture.

Prior Cargo Lists FOSFA: Acceptable

Regulatory Properties: Pollution Cat (c): Z / Ship Type (e): 3

Technical Specification

####### Packaging, Storage and Transportation Requirements

UAN is typically transported with a rust-preventing agent. UAN-32 solution crystallizes at temperatures below 2°C, so shipments in cold weather or climates should ensure proper heating. At higher temperatures, UAN crystals dissolve, restoring the chemical's properties. It is recommended that water not be added to UAN during storage, as water will trigger corrosive activity.

In terms of human exposure to its components (ammonium nitrate and urea), UAN is a medium-risk substance. Safety measures should be observed when applying UAN, and personal protective equipment should be used.

Exposure Limits:

TLV-TWA: 5.0 ppm

TLV-STEL: Not specified

Odor Threshold: 45 ppm

Another risk factor is ammonia, which may accumulate in tanks used for UAN storage and transportation. The applicable MSDS sheet and International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code should be consulted prior to any loading and carriage.

###### Molasses

Molasses is not an oil but is often carried in oil tankers. It requires stowage in tanks where the last three cargoes must have been lead-free. Tank cleaning for this cargo does not normally require the use of chemicals. However, as with vegetable oils, special cleaning instructions will be issued.

Molasses has a density of approximately 1.4. To avoid overstressing tank bulkheads, no tank should contain a greater weight of cargo than if the tank were full of saltwater ballast.

During tank draining, steam is injected into the tank ullage space to encourage the molasses to run down the bulkheads and improve outturn.

The required cargo temperature is approximately 40°C. However, it must not exceed 46°C, or the molasses will caramelize onto the heating coils. Water/steam and molasses form acetic acid, which will attack tank coatings and uncoated steel.

Therefore, if possible, ballast should not be loaded into unwashed tanks, or if this is unavoidable, the residence time should be kept to a minimum. Tanks should be washed as soon as possible after discharge.

###### De-Asphaltised Cylinder Oil (DACO)

DACO is a high-viscosity lubricating oil extract used for blending with neutral oils in preparing automotive engine lubricating oils. Before and after tank cleaning requirements are the same as for any other high-viscosity lubricating oil.

###### Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO)

Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) is a waxy distillate typically used as a cat cracker feedstock but can also be used as a blending component. This product is both salt and metal critical, particularly when used as a feedstock. It can be carried on black or white oil vessels.

Tank cleaning requirements for VGO can vary depending on the end use of the product. For example, vessels may be chartered "dirty" to carry VGO with no particular requirement to clean before loading. However, if the end use is as a feedstock, extensive cleaning followed by a freshwater rinse of tanks and pipelines is generally required.

Tank cleaning requirements will generally be advised before loading this product. In cases where no specific cleaning instructions have been given, Masters must seek advice from Charterers on the standard required.

As VGO can have a Pour Point of up to 40°C, it may require heating. Heavy deposits of wax may be experienced following the discharge of VGO, necessitating a hot wash before loading a subsequent cargo, which otherwise would not have been necessary.



### 8.2.5 Vapour Emission Control System - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Chemical Tanker Vapour Emission Control (VEC) Systems

###### Introduction

Use and operate the vapour emission control system as per current regulations and the requirements of the shore installation. Be aware of the operation of the VEC system on board (if fitted). Note that significant operational and safety implications are present as the shore and the ship are effectively joined together as one unit.

###### Vapour Emission Control (VEC) Systems

Refer also to IMS Chapter 8.1.5 Inert Gas Management – VECS Operation

The primary hazards are that:

The ship loses effective control of the tank atmosphere pressure.

The ship is directly influenced by any changes within the terminal's system.

Note: It is important that pressure sensing devices on the vessel are well maintained. Additionally, individual cargo tank P.V. valves must be properly maintained and operate correctly.

VECS must have an independent alarm giving audible and visual warnings when maximum and minimum vapor pressures are exceeded.

Test these alarms prior to beginning loading, unless the system is provided with an electronic self-testing capability. Always maintain fixed gauging systems in a fully operational condition.

Do not open tanks to the atmosphere for gauging or sampling when connected to the shore vapour collecting system unless:

Loading to the tank is stopped.

The tank is isolated from any other tank being loaded.

Precautions are taken to reduce any pressure within the cargo tank vapour space.

The ship's system must be provided with means to collect and drain condensed vapour that may accumulate in the pipelines. Drains must be installed at low points within the ship's piping system. Check these drains are clear before each use of the VEC system and regularly when the system is not in use.

Take care to ensure that no possibility of misconnection of vapour and liquid hoses can occur.

The ship's vapour connection must be clearly identified. Paint the outboard 1 metre of piping with yellow and red bands and mark it with the word "Vapour" at the 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock positions. The vessel’s presentation flange should be fitted with a stud to prevent incorrect connections.

Electrically bond all pipework to the hull to prevent electrostatic build-up within vapour return pipework. Periodically check the integrity of these connections.

Discuss the full procedures for using the VEC system at the pre-transfer meeting between the terminal representative and the chief officer. Compile a separate set of transfer procedures describing the use of the VEC system as required by 33 CFR 155.750(d).

###### Vapour Tightness Documentation

According to CFR 46, 61.302 (3), terminals in the USA must obtain a copy of the “Vapour Tightness Document” from the vessel. CFR 46, 61.304 (f) describes the procedure to perform this vapour tightness test.

Perform the above test before arriving at US ports and prior to loading sensitive, toxic, or flammable cargo. Fill in form TANK 28 & TANK 28A and send them to the office.

The test is valid for 12 months.

Following paragraphs are extracted from CFR 46 Parts 61 to 71 (current edition):

61.302

    - “(3) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall obtain a copy of the marine vessel’s vapour-tightness documentation described in 61.305(h) for a test conducted within the preceding 12 months in accordance with 61.304(f).”

61.304

    - “(f) The following test method shall be used to comply with the marine vessel vapour-tightness requirements of 61.302(e)(3): a) Each benzene product tank shall be pressurized with dry air or inert gas to not less than 1.0 psig and not more than the pressure of the lowest relief valve setting. b) Once the pressure is obtained, the dry air or inert gas source shall be cut off. c) At the end of one half-hour, the pressure in the benzene product tank and piping shall be measured. The change in pressure shall be calculated using the following formula: ΔP = Pi – Pr Where: ΔP = change in pressure, inches in water. Pi = Pressure in tank when air/gas sources are shut off, inches of water. Pr = Pressure in tank at the end of one half-hour after air/gas source is shut off, inches of water.

    - The change in pressure, ΔP, shall be compared to the pressure drop calculated using the following formula: ΔPM = 0.861 Pia L/V Where: ΔPM = Maximum allowable pressure change, inches of water. Pia = Pressure in tank when air/gas source is shut off, pounds per square inch, absolute (psia). L = Maximum permitted loading rate of vessel, barrels per hour. V = Total volume of product tank, barrels.”

61.305

    - “(5) If ΔP < ΔPM, the vessel is vapour tight. (6) If ΔP > ΔPM, the vessel is not vapour tight and the source of the leak must be identified and repaired prior to retesting.

    - The Vapour Tightness Document shall contain the following data:

    - Header information about the subject tanks being tested in accordance with the national emission standard for benzene emissions from benzene transfer operations, CFR 46, section 61.304(f).

### 8.2.6 Tank Cleaning Chemicals - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Tank Cleaning after Chemical Cargoes

Follo the procedure for tank cleaning as described in Miracle Software.

###### Cleaning Chemicals and Equipment

Order chemicals required for tank cleaning through the company when the vessel is under voyage charter, or through the charterers if the vessel is under time charter.

MARPOL Annex II provides guidance on the use of cleaning additives and the type of additives that are acceptable. Additives meeting the requirements of MARPOL Annex II are listed in Annex 10 of the MEPC.2/Circ. issued in December each year.

The format of Annex 10 of the MEPC.2/Circ. indicates that the additives have been evaluated as per MEPC.1/Circ.590 and remain valid.

Use the cleaning methods described below, ensuring the cleaning agents remain acceptable as per the MARPOL list:

Sea water cleaning

Cold wash HD

Alkaline liquid

Phosphoric acid metal cleaner

Product Hcf: Water-based neutral Hcf

Product Lac: Liquid alkaline cleaner

Recirculation with bleach solution

Acrylic Monomer Neutraliser / Deodoriser - Guidelines for cleaning from Acrylates

Acrylic Monomer Neutraliser - Guidelines to improve Wall Wash Results

####### Cleaning Additives and Agents in Tank Cleaning Wash Water

Cleaning agents or additives, used either diluted with water or on their own, may be required to remove previous products, smells, or staining from cargo tanks. The following MARPOL Annex II provisions apply:

Whenever a washing medium is used instead of water, its discharge is governed by the provisions of MARPOL Annex I or Annex II, which would apply to the medium had it been carried as cargo. In other words, a cleaning agent should be considered a pollutant.

When small amounts of cleaning additives (detergent products) are added to water to facilitate tank washing, no restrictions additional to those applicable to the tank due to the previous cargo are necessary. Using products containing more than 10% of the total weight of the cleaning additive of pollution Category X components is not permitted. These IMO-approved cleaning additives are considered non-pollutants.

If there is any doubt as to whether a product falls under the provisions of MARPOL, then the product must be considered a pollutant and must be disposed of as per the provisions of MARPOL Annex I or II as necessary. Record the use of either a cleaning additive or a cleaning agent in the bridge logbook.

####### Sea Water Cleaning

Seawater is most commonly used for tank cleaning. Certain conditions apply when using seawater:

When the ship's washing water intake is close to the seabed (in ports or rivers), take samples at intervals to examine the seawater purity. If the sample is found to be contaminated by mud, sand, or other seabed impurities that may affect the tank cleaning, the washing may have to be postponed.

Monitor and maintain washing water temperature, considering:

Type of tank coating (organic, inorganic coating, and stainless steel)

Adjacent tank surface temperature

Use the correct pressure to obtain maximum performance of the cleaning machines. Consult the manufacturers’ manual, in respect to both portable and fixed tank cleaning machines.

Evaluate the following criteria to determine the time needed to clean a tank:

Last cargo characteristic

Type of tank lining (organic, inorganic coating, and stainless steel)

Adjacent tank surface temperature

Based on the above criteria, establish the tank cleaning time by the number of machine (portable or fixed) cycle times, referring to the manufacturers’ manual.

####### Cold Wash HD

####### Recirculation with Bleach Solution

Bleach, also known as Chlorox and Dixichlor, is a sodium hypochlorite solution (11-13%) and a strong oxidizer. Certain precautions should be observed since this product is very aggressive, particularly to stainless steel. Its aggressiveness increases with raised temperatures. It can be more aggressive to stainless steel than seawater. Bleach solution must not be allowed to dry on air tank lining or be stored in cargo tanks as a cleaning solution or slop. Bleach solution should mainly be used in coated tanks and diluted to a maximum 1% strength.

Uses:

Removal of odour, if present after normal tank cleaning.

Removal of colour, if present after normal tank cleaning.

Improving PTT if low after normal tank cleaning.

Application Method

a) Re-circulation

A diluted bleach of maximum 1% strength should be re-circulated at a temperature of 50°C. The temperature is important for the purpose of "opening the coating," but must not be exceeded due to the solution's aggressiveness.

The method of re-circulation should be used because it will reach all tank surfaces. Hand spraying is not allowed.

For product information and personnel safety, refer to the product MSDS supplied with containers (drums).

For additional information, refer to Sodium Hypochlorite solution.

Procedure:

Prepare the tank for re-circulation.

After any seawater washing, ensure to thoroughly rinse the tank with fresh water before preparing the bleach solution.

Add a minimum of 10-13 drums (depending on the bleach concentration in the drums) of fresh water to the tank (fresh water first). Add 1 drum of bleach into the tank (drop line). Secure the tank and start the re-circulation immediately.

Apply the tank heating system and bring the temperature up to a maximum of 50°C (monitor tank temperature from remote readings). From the moment the temperature is reached, continue re-circulation for 1 to 2 machine cycles depending on the cleaning problem (for portable machines, use 1 to 2 cycles on each drop).

On completion, close the tank heating system.

If a second tank needs the same cleaning method, it should be prepared for re-circulation prior to transferring the used bleach solution. (The same bleach solution may be used in 2 tanks before disposing of it).

Immediately after the re-circulation, rinse the tank with warm seawater (55°C) for at least 3 machine cycles (per drop for portable machines).

At the end of rinsing, take a sample from the discharge line and inspect it for traces of remaining bleach (odor, foam, pH value above 7, etc.). If the bleach solution is still present, continue rinsing until it is removed. After rinsing with seawater, continue rinsing with fresh water to remove the salt/chlorides (if bleach is present on coating, it will affect a chloride test).

Warning

If the bleach solution is not washed off immediately after re-circulation or is stored in cargo tanks, particularly stainless-steel tanks, corrosion can be expected very soon.

####### Acrylic Monomer Neutraliser / Deodoriser - Cleaning From Acrylates

This product is specially formulated to neutralize and deodorize acrylic monomers by reducing/removing acrylate odour. For product information and personnel safety, refer to the product MSDS. One litre of Product X will neutralize one litre of acrylate. To use this method, the tank must have been inerted during discharging and equipped with fixed tank cleaning machines. (For inerting, refer to the IG Manual).

- Make a 5% solution (use fresh water) in the tank

- At commencement of re circulation via the tank washing machines, apply heat to the coils.

- When the temperature has reached 50°C, maintain the temperature throughout the washing and re circulate one machine cycle (per drop for portable machines).

- Rinsing off with warm fresh water for one washing machine cycle (per drop for portable machines). If insufficient fresh water, the tank can be rinsed with warm/hot sea water.

##### Ultra Violet (UV) Spectrum Test Guidance

The cargoes covered by the chemical families: aromatics and chlorinated hydrocarbons, affect this test.

UV testing cannot accurately be carried out on board, and the ship should select cleaning methods that dilute and remove aromatics and chlorinated hydrocarbons.

Occasionally, the wall wash may be tested for both UV and Non-Volatile Matter (NVM). Acceptance or failure of a cargo tank is often based on more than one test method, besides the visual tank inspection.

If the ship is at sea when preparing tanks for UV testing, keep in mind that the cleaning agent may affect the UV test. To assist in the selection of the next cleaning procedure(s), when a tank is rejected, request the cargo tank surveyor to advise if it was "close” or far off.

Guidance When Preparing the Tank for a Nonvolatile Matter Test (NVM)

NVM testing cannot be accurately carried out on board, and the ship should select cleaning methods that dilute and remove vegetable oils and fats. This test is carried out to determine the weight of residue (MG/100 ML - PPM) left on the tank surface.

The NVM detected usually originates from the previous cargo but can contain other elements such as rust, dust, and tank cleaning product that was not properly rinsed off during tank washing. If the ship is in port when preparing tanks for NVM testing, a pre-inspection should be arranged. It is advisable to carry out spot testing in the tank using a spray bottle containing a strong solvent such as acetone or hexane. Shortly after spraying small areas, the bulkhead will dry and give you an indication. When the area sprayed becomes surrounded by a visible oily boundary ("burn marks"), the tank lining contains residue from the previous cargo. When this indication is seen, it will also be detected by a laboratory NVM test. The following can be used as an indication:

Spot testing that does not leave any "burn marks" on the bulkhead indicates a low PPM of NVM.

Clear oily "burn marks" indicate a high PPM of NVM.

To assist in the selection of the next cleaning procedure(s), when a tank is rejected, the cargo tank surveyor should be requested to advise the actual PPM.

##### Wall Wash Test

For quality control and expediting cargo tank readiness, a Wall Wash Test Kit is aboard all chemical tankers. Included within the kit are two copies of a booklet containing:

A list of apparatus

Instructions for performing the following tests:

Colour of clear liquids

Detection of hydrocarbons

Detection of chlorides

Permanganate Time Test

MSDS of Nitric Acid and Hydrochloric Acid

Instructions for cleaning the equipment

The vessel will be advised by the Office when a particular test is to be undertaken and to which standard. A Port Captain would normally be expected to attend the vessel when these tests are carried out. However, there will be occasions when the Master will be required to undertake these tests and report the findings accurately. Therefore, it is important that the Master and senior officers become familiar with all the apparatus and the safety procedures to be followed.

Caution: Nitric acid and hydrochloric acid are corrosive. They may burn skin, eyes, and intestines if swallowed. Great care should be exercised when using these substances, particularly when "pipeting."

The Chief Officer is responsible for the safekeeping of this kit and all its contents. It is strongly recommended that the kit be stored under lock and key. The contents of this kit are not to be used for other purposes.

###### Wall Wash Test Kit Apparatus

###### Standard Test Method of Clear Liquids

(Platinum - Cobalt Scale) ASTM-D1209

The following method describes a procedure for the visual measurement of the color of essentially light-colored liquids.

From the stock solution, prepare standards in accordance with Table I by diluting the required volumes to 100 ml with distilled water in the Nessler tube. Cap the tubes and seal the caps with shellac or waterproof cement if long-term storage is desired (Note: this standard would be stable for at least a year).

Wall wash the tank using the appropriate solvent (e.g., acetone, etc., as applicable) and introduce 100 ml of the specimen into a Nessler tube, passing the specimen through a filter if it has any visible turbidity.

Report the standard number color that most matches the specimen. In the event that the color lies midway between two standards, report the darker of the two or otherwise report the range over which an apparent match is obtained.

TABLE I

###### Standard Method of Test for Detecting Hydrocarbons in SMA-42-60

This method describes a procedure for detecting the presence of hydrocarbons in the reagent by observing any cloudiness or opalescence when the sample is diluted with distilled water.

Wall wash the tank (about 1m²) and dilute 15 ml of this sample with 45 ml of distilled water in a 100 ml color comparison tube.

Invert the tube several times to ensure complete mixing and allow it to stand for twenty minutes at room temperature.

Fill a 100 ml blank tube with 60 ml of distilled water.

Compare the sample to the distilled water blank by looking down through the tube against a black background. To pass the test, no cloudiness or opalescence should appear at any time during the test period.

###### Standard Method of Test for Detecting Chlorides

This method describes a procedure for detecting chloride ions.

Measure 20 ml of distilled water into each of the Nessler tubes (50 ml tubes).

Pipette 5 ml of Wall Wash reagent sample into one of the Nessler tubes (Tube A).

Pipette 5 ml of reagent used in the Wall Wash into another Nessler tube (Tube B). This will be the blank to check whether the reagent used is contaminated.

Pipette 0.25 ml of Standard Chloride solution (100 ppm) into another Nessler tube (Tube C). This will be the 4 ppm Chlorides standard.

Pipette 1 ml of 20% Nitric Acid and 1 ml of 0.1 Silver Nitrate Solution into all three Nessler tubes.

Cap all tubes and mix well by inverting several times.

Allow the contents to stand for 10 minutes in the dark before comparing the sample (Tube A) with the standard (Tube C) by viewing the tubes against a black background.

###### Reporting

If the sample cloudiness (Tube A) is less than that of the 5 ppm standard (Tube C), report as less than 5 ppm chlorides. Always check the blank (Tube B) to ensure that the reagent used is not contaminated. It should not have any cloudiness and must be clear and transparent.

If higher values of chlorides are required, then the following volumes of the Standard Chloride solution (100 ppm) should be added to Tube C (Step A):

0.50 ml of Chloride Solution for 10 ppm

0.75 ml of Chloride Solution for 15 ppm

1.00 ml of Chloride Solution for 20 ppm

1.25 ml of Chloride Solution for 25 ppm

1.50 ml of Chloride Solution for 30 ppm

1.75 ml of Chloride Solution for 35 ppm

2.00 ml of Chloride Solution for 40 ppm

2.50 ml of Chloride Solution for 45 ppm

2.75 ml of Chloride Solution for 50 ppm

Records of the Wall Wash Test are maintained using the form CHEM-09 “Wall Wash Test Report”.

###### Standard Test Method for Permanganate Time Test ASTM-D1363

This method covers the detection of impurities in alcohol or ketones that reduce potassium permanganate.

Fill a 50 ml glass stoppered Nessler tube beyond the mark with the sample under test and place it in a constant temperature bath (25°C for Acetone). Maintain the water level in the bath approximately 25 mm below the top of the tube.

When the sample has reached the bath temperature (about 5 minutes), bring up the level to the 50 ml mark. Add 2 ml of potassium permanganate solution with a pipette. Stopper the tube, invert once to mix the contents, return to the bath, and note the time.

Dissolve 0.1 g of KMnO4 in 500 ml distilled water. From this standard solution, take 50 ml and put it in a 50 ml stoppered Nessler tube, keeping it in the same bath as the sample.

At the end of the minimum time specified for the material being tested, remove the tubes and compare the color of the standard by viewing downward through the tube against a white background.

If the residual pink color of the sample is greater than the standard, report the permanganate time as "greater than X minutes." If the residual color of the sample is equal to that of the standard, report the permanganate time as "X minutes." If the residual pink color of the sample is less than the standard, report as "less than X minutes," where "X minutes" is the minimum time specified for the material being tested.

###### Cleaning and Usage of Equipment

The following notes are guidelines for the care and cleaning of the equipment. Cleanliness of equipment is paramount to ensure accurate test results.

- On completion of each test, all equipment should be drained, rinsed with distilled (DI) water, and allowed to dry.

- If the equipment is not to be used for some time, all apparatus should be carefully stowed in the Igloo Box provided.

- Immediately prior to use, the equipment must be thoroughly cleaned by:

- Rinsing with a small quantity of Hydrochloric Acid and draining.

- Rinsing with DI water, draining, and allowing it to dry.

Caution: ALWAYS OBSERVE PERSONAL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WHEN HANDLING COMPONENTS OF THE WALL WASH TEST KIT

##### Cargo Tank Steaming

Occasionally, tanks, particularly those with zinc coatings, can only be adequately cleaned by steaming after the carriage of certain chemical products.

Steaming of cargo tanks can present significant risks with respect to the generation of electrostatic charges and must not be carried out in any compartment without first consulting the company. If steaming is required, the procedures below must be complied with.

Steaming may only be carried out in tanks that have either been inerted, water washed and gas freed, or where the previous cargo in the compartment was non-flammable.

The concentration of flammable gas should not exceed 1.0% of the LFL, measured immediately prior to steaming.

###### Methods of Steaming

Steaming is carried out for several reasons:

To evaporate volatile residues

To remove smell

To reduce chlorides

If steaming is required to remove residues, then the higher the temperature the better, consistent with manufacturer or class recommendations with respect to the maximum temperature that the cargo tank coating may be subjected to. Such steaming is enhanced if adjacent tanks are empty. If steaming is utilized to remove chlorides, then the compartment bulkheads should be cool to increase condensation to wash the chlorides away.

Precautions must be taken to avoid the build-up of steam pressure within the tank. A hatch or tank lid must remain at least partially open when steaming a cargo tank. Care must also be taken to ensure the increase in temperature in the compartment being steamed does not affect adjacent compartments.

###### Monitoring of the Atmosphere

Steaming can produce mist clouds which may be electrostatically charged. The effects and possible hazards from such clouds are similar to those described for the mists created by water washing, but levels of charging are much higher. The time required to reach maximum charge levels is also very much less. Furthermore, although a tank may be almost free of hydrocarbon gas at the start of steaming, the heat and disturbance will often release gases and pockets of flammability may build up.

Unless the compartment has been inerted, it is important that the atmosphere during steaming is carefully and continuously monitored and is maintained at a level not exceeding 35% of the LFL. If the level reaches 35% LFL at any measured location, steaming MUST cease immediately. The frequency of checking the atmosphere will depend on the build-up of flammable gases; as gases are released and the concentration increases, so the frequency of monitoring should also increase to prevent the atmosphere from exceeding 35% LFL.

Maintain a record of the monitoring of tank atmospheres during steaming using the form CHEM 06 “Atmosphere Check – Steaming”.

##### Pre-Cleaning of Cargo Tanks

Certain cargoes require tanks to be pre-cleaned before the main tank cleaning process of preparing the tanks for the next cargo. Some examples where pre-cleaning is required are:

###### Polymerizing Cargo (e.g., Styrene Monomer)

Polymerizing cargoes are carried with additives (inhibitors) added for stabilizing the cargo during carriage.

On completion of discharge, the remnants of the cargo in the tank and associated structures of vents, pipelines, valves, etc., if not cleaned immediately, may result in polymerizing due to the bulk cargo along with inhibitor having been discharged.

Immediately on completion of discharge and issue of the “Empty tank” certificate, carry out a pre-clean with a minimum wash of one cycle of the tank cleaning machines covering the entire surface of the tank using cold water.

If possible, flush the vents and pipelines/valves with water. The slops can be left at the bottom of the tank, to be dealt with during the tank cleaning process.

###### Drying Oils (e.g., Soya Bean Oil)

If these cargoes are not pre-cleaned immediately on completion of discharge, the remnants on the tank surface may oxidize, leaving a very tough film on the surface which can convert a relatively easy tank cleaning operation into a difficult, time-consuming operation requiring strong chemicals.

As with polymerizing cargoes, immediately on completion of discharge and issue of the “Empty tank” certificate, carry out a pre-clean with a minimum wash of one cycle of the tank cleaning machines covering the entire surface of the tank.

If possible, flush the vents and pipelines/valves with water. The slops can be left at the bottom of the tank, to be dealt with during the course of the tank cleaning process.

###### Water Miscible Cargoes

Described as completely water-soluble, partly or not water-soluble, completely water-soluble cargoes will be much easier to deal with, with the quantity and the time required to wash the tank being reduced. Heating the water may further reduce the cleaning time.

###### Water Reactive Cargoes

Certain cargoes such as MDI/TDI are water-reactive cargoes which, if exposed to water or humidity, will leave very tough residues on the tank surface and associated fittings. These then require special tank cleaning procedures involving strong chemicals and extended time to get rid of the residues. Conduct a pre-clean using chemicals (e.g., Methylene chloride) which dissolve the cargo residues. This wash is carried out under a nitrogen blanket, and the pre-wash is then discharged ashore. The requirements of the pre-cleaning are to be agreed upon with the charterer at the time of the cargo being fixed, as it may require a shore supply of solvents, additional time, and suitable shore reception for the disposal of the pre-cleaned slops.

Other cargoes may require pre-cleaning; necessary guidance and instructions should be sought from the charterer/Company. In all cases, the safety of life, the vessel, and the environment has overriding priority over any commercial demand imposed on the vessel by any entity.

###### Sulphuric Acid

Sulphuric acid reacts with water, giving off a lot of heat.

As the concentration of the sulphuric acid reduces from its normal carriage concentration of >98%, it becomes more corrosive and will affect even stainless steel.

It is recommended to commence the wash with large quantities of water and keep washing and pumping out the slops to avoid reaching a pH of 7.

When starting tank cleaning operations, use large quantities of water to quickly dilute the acid and pump it out simultaneously.

Additional use of tank cleaning machines is recommended. Do not allow the diluted acid to accumulate in any part of the cargo system.

##### Non-Acceptable Cleaning Methods

The following cleaning methods are not acceptable or allowed:

Spraying

Toluene and other static accumulator steaming or recirculation in non-inerted tanks

Recirculation of low flash or static accumulator product in a non-inert atmosphere

Using Metal bright (Phosphoric Acid) or Caustic Soda in zinc-coated tanks

Mixing chlorinated solvent with water (this forms acid compounds that both damage the tank coating and rapidly reduce the cleaning power of the solvent)

Partial cleaning of cargo tank (only cleaning of surveyor accessible areas). Using Butterworth machines to rinse with DI water is the most effective method to reach all areas.

Bleach in zinc or epoxy-coated tanks without prior approval from the office.

Caution: Do not use heated bleach solutions due to their destructive effects on SS parts in the cargo tanks (cargo pump and heating coils). Advise the Ship Operator whenever cleaning by ventilation is planned, as charterers for the next cargo might not allow only ventilation as a cleaning method. Some cargoes may not require the tank walls to be washed with water but consider the associated pipeline system. Flush the tank sump with enough fresh water so that the pump will drive a plug of water through the lines, clearing any residue remaining.

In all cases, whenever unsafe conditions are detected on board or nearby which may be increased through continued cleaning operations, halt the cleaning operations until those unsafe conditions are rectified. Use new cleaning methods or new cleaning chemicals only after obtaining permission from the ship operator, the Office, and the coating manufacturer. Before using any new method or chemicals, carry out a risk assessment, considering coating compatibility and available resources/equipment. Follow all safety rules and guidelines. Send a full report detailing results, method, time, quantities used, and effectiveness to the ship operator and copy the Office.

Note:	Master must authorize any tank cleaning.

###### Solvent Steaming

Do not steam with solvents. If the vessel is requested to carry out such a procedure, immediately inform the operations department for a decision on how to proceed.

##### Tank Cleaning After Discharging Vegetable Oils

For the effective cleaning of animal and vegetable oils, the initial cleaning is of the utmost importance. Observe the following steps:

Do a pre-wash as soon as possible, either after the completion of discharge or after sailing. Use either hot or cold water for the initial wash depending on the type of vegetable oil.

High water hardness (magnesium and calcium) involves the risk of formation of magnesium and calcium soaps (white or sticky residues).

If tank cleaning is performed in areas with a low seawater temperature, it is advisable to take out ballast, if possible, from the section where the tank cleaning is planned.

Before starting a hot seawater wash, check the tank for areas where there are significant accumulations of product, and plan the cleaning using manual machines accordingly.

For vessels with fixed machines, use as many portable machines as possible for each tank, in addition to the fixed machines.

Various methods may be utilized for cleaning with chemicals, and the recommendations of the applicable tank cleaning guide (such as Miracle) should be adhered to. However, generally a detergent such as Teepol will be used.

Fats and fatty oils may dry and harden under the action of atmospheric oxygen, forming a tough, resin-like mass. This oxidation occurs in three phases: liquid, then gum, and finally solid. Therefore, pre-cleaning should commence as soon as possible after the issue of the Tank Dry Certificate.

High water temperatures, steaming, and heated cargoes in adjacent tanks should be avoided, if possible, until cleaning has been completed.

1. Non-Drying Oils

Contact with oxygen does not cause any appreciable drying. Tanks are easy to clean. Hot water should be used for the initial wash.

Non-drying products and their melting point (°C):

Palm Oil: 37°C

Coconut Oil: 25°C

Palm Kernel Oil: 27°C

Lard: 40°C

Tallow: 42°C

2. Semi-Drying Oils

These oils dry within acceptable limits, making tank cleaning marginally more difficult. Cold water should be used for the initial wash.

Semi-drying oils and their melting point (°C):

Olive Oil: 3°C

Sesame Oil: 2°C

Castor Oil: 10°C

Maize Oil: 11°C

Tea Seed Oil: 3°C

Sunflower Seed Oil: 17°C

Groundnut Oil: 2°C

Soya Bean Oil: 21°C

Cotton Seed Oil: 1°C

Rape Seed Oil: 9°C

3. Drying Oils

These oils dry rapidly on contact with atmospheric oxygen. Considerable cargo residues are left on tank walls by rapid drying of the oils, making tank cleaning markedly more difficult. Cold water should be used for the initial wash.

If unable to start the cleaning operation immediately after the discharge of drying oils, consider injecting steam into the tank to prevent the oil from drying. Monitor the state of the tank and inject further steam as necessary.

Drying oils and their melting point (°C):

Safflower Oil: 15°C

Poppy Seed Oil: 18°C

Linseed Oil: 20°C

Tung Oil: 5°C

Fish Oil: 12°C

Whale Oil: 10°C

Tank Cleaning After Discharging Flammable Products

Keep the tanks inerted after the discharge of flammable products, before tank cleaning, and during tank washing.

Avoid an unsafe mixture in the tanks by either using inert gas (for ships fitted with an IG plant) or nitrogen gas supplied from shore.

Inerting should continue, always maintaining oxygen content at less than 8%.

Draining out cargo may be a difficult process to carry out safely, so water flushing and subsequent draining of the piping may be necessary.

Thereafter, drain water from the piping system.

##### Tank Cleaning Table for Undefined Atmosphere

####### Tanks washed after carriage of Annex II cargoes.

For the purpose of this procedure, the term "volatile" refers to a cargo that is capable of being ignited and burning.

Cargoes with a flashpoint below 60°C, as determined by the closed-cup method of testing, are considered volatile.

If a cargo is being handled at a temperature within 10°C of its flashpoint, it shall be considered volatile. Thus, a cargo with a flashpoint of 80°C shall be considered volatile if handled at a temperature of 70°C or above.

Cargoes having a notation “T” in column “k” of IBC Code Chapter 17 or List-1/List-3 of the latest MEPC.2 circular are toxic.

Subsequent washing after gas freeing, as per the above table, may be carried out without restriction.

##### Cargo Tanks Venting System

###### Venting Capacity

Both primary and secondary venting systems facilitate dilution of vapors in the atmosphere well clear of the deck. Vents are sited to prevent the accumulation of an explosive atmosphere on the tank deck or around the accommodation or engine room housings.

###### Primary and Secondary Venting Systems

The primary venting system is the individual cargo tank P/V valves.

The secondary venting system is a cargo tank pressure monitoring system.

###### Venting After Aggressive Cargoes

Cargoes having a vapor pressure greater than 5 Kpa at 20°C can be cleaned by ventilation. This can have a bearing on commercial operations, as such cargoes do not require extensive cleaning after discharge, and there are no MARPOL regulations governing the discharge of water from a tank cleaned by ventilation. The procedures for tank cleaning by ventilation are described in detail in the ship-specific Procedures and Arrangements Manual Appendix C.

If toxic cargoes are going to be ventilated, great precautions are required by controlling the ventilation, altering the ship's course, and using suitable personal protective equipment.

Epoxy paint coatings absorb solvents, making the coating soft. The problems include damage to the tank coating and contamination of the next cargo. To return the coating to its original condition, the cargo vapor must be released from the coating by ventilation. The release is faster if the steel temperature is high. This steel temperature increase can be achieved by heating the adjacent compartment. Heating of the tank may also be achieved by keeping the steam heating coils slightly open. The ventilation for releasing the cargo vapor from the coating must be devoid of moisture. When dry air contacts the cargo vapor in the coating, the vapor gets absorbed by the air and carried away. The ventilation flow must reach the bottom of the tank, and the exit must be from the tank top at the other end of the tank.

For many cargoes, ventilation is the only acceptable means of removing the last traces from epoxy-coated tanks. For such cargoes, bottom flushing with water is not effective. Read the paint manufacturer’s instructions for the next cargo. It may say—only warm organic cargoes. Ensure attention is paid to the footnotes.

Some of the cargoes that are bad for epoxy coatings and better off in stainless steel or zinc tanks are: Acetone, Acrylonitrile, Ethanol, Methanol, IPA, MEK, Methyl Acrylate, and Vinyl Acetate Monomer.

###### Venting After Discharge of Toxic Cargo

Venting of tanks after discharge of toxic cargo should be through the vessel’s approved gas freeing outlets, ensuring the exit velocity is sufficient to carry the vapors clear of the deck in compliance with IBC Code 15.12. When venting is performed through a high-velocity valve requiring an exit velocity of at least 30 m/s, ensure that airflow into the tank is adequate to achieve this. In determining the required airflow, consider the capacity of the vent fan and the number of tanks to be vented simultaneously.

No escape of cargo vapors should occur at deck level before the concentration within the tank has fallen below 30% LEL and the relevant TLV. Thereafter, final clearance of the vapor mixture may continue at tank deck level through other larger deck openings.

In addition, follow the guidelines provided in TSG (Chemicals).

###### Tank Spraying Methods for Tank Cleaning

WARNING:

Cleaning by spraying cleaning agents in tanks (e.g., methanol or others) is not permitted.

##### Squeegeeing and Puddling

###### Introduction

After the carriage of animal and vegetable oils, manual sweeping of the cargo tanks may be necessary to push the semi-liquid residues towards the pump suction to complete the discharge. Despite the natural origins of such cargoes, it is essential that the ship's enclosed space entry procedures are complied with on every occasion that personnel are sent into an enclosed space.

Caution: Prior to personnel entering the tank(s), all Enclosed Space Entry precautions and procedures shall be in place. Follow full enclosed space entry procedures as detailed in the ISM, with additional checks made for CO. Failure to follow these precautions may result in fatalities.

###### Identified Dangers

Decomposition and Putrefaction: Most animal and vegetable oils undergo decomposition, generating obnoxious and toxic vapors and depleting the oxygen in the tank. Proper ventilation and atmosphere testing are crucial before tank entry, especially for sweeping purposes.

Carbon Monoxide (CO) Hazards: Certain vegetable oils can produce CO, particularly during heating and the final stages of discharge, with levels reaching in excess of 3,000 ppm. Before entering a tank for either “squeezing” the last remaining cargo or for tank cleaning, the following precautions must be taken:

Regularly monitor the atmosphere of the tanks throughout discharge for CO presence.

Measure temperatures, as excessive temperatures can increase CO production.

Note: The eight-hour safe exposure limit for CO is 30 ppm, with short-term exposure (15 minutes) allowed up to 200 ppm under exceptional circumstances.

Caution:

CO is toxic by inhalation and can cause serious health damage.

Use the 4-runner portable gas instrument to measure O2/HC/CO/H2S with ventilation stopped.

Slips and Falls: Slips and falls present a considerable danger to persons working inside the tanks.

Squeegeeing and Puddling Procedure

- Maintain Correct Temperatures:

- For cargoes requiring “squeezing” (sweeping), maintain correct voyage and discharge temperatures. Check the tank bottoms for hard factions well before arrival at the discharge port.

- Maintain the required temperature throughout the discharge operation by gradually reducing the heating medium as the tank slackens.

- Heating Management:

- Shut off the heating in the final stages of discharge before exposing the heating coils. This prevents burning the cargo as the heating coils become exposed and avoids burns to personnel entering the tanks.

- Ventilation:

- At least one hour before commencing “squeezing” (sweeping) operations, put the air blowers on the tank to ensure a safe atmosphere during operations. Ensure the tank is sufficiently ventilated prior to man entry.

- Pay special attention to the possibility of CO being present in tanks that contained vegetable oils.

- Monitor CO content, LEL, O2, and H2S levels in the tanks before and during “squeezing” (sweeping) operations. Ensure continuous and effective mechanical ventilation of the tanks.

Note: The mechanical ventilation of the tanks must be effective and in continuous operation throughout.

- Running Vent Fans:

- While squeegeeing vegetable oils, run the vent fans. Oxidizing and putrefying vegetable/animal oils are dangerous for the sweeper.

- Responsibility and Control:

- The shore staff should be left in no doubt that the responsibility and control of all sweeping operations are under the management of the ship's crew. Follow the safety advice given in the next section - Safety Information for Shore Personnel.

- Winter Considerations:

- In winter, for high pour point cargoes, perform these jobs quickly and efficiently, as cold venting air can cause clingage and unpumpables. This may lead the surveyor to demand a fresh intake of hot cargo and require the job to be redone.

Note:	This will cause surveyor to demand fresh intake of hot cargo and redoing the whole job a second time.

### 8.2.7 Precautions Against Electrostatic Hazards - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Electrostatic and Stray Current Hazards

###### Introduction

Refer to IMS Chapter 8.1.10 – Special Cargoes (Handling Static Accumulator Cargoes)

Whenever two dissimilar materials come into contact, charge separation occurs at the interface.

A charge of one sign moves from material A to B, causing materials A and B to become respectively negatively and positively charged. While the materials remain in contact and immobile relative to one another, the charges are extremely close together.

The voltage difference between the charges of opposite signs is then very small, posing no hazard.

When the charges are separated, a large voltage difference develops between them. Additionally, a voltage distribution is set up throughout the neighbouring space, known as an electrostatic field.

Separated charges attempt to recombine and neutralize each other, a process called charge relaxation.

If one or both separated materials carrying charge is a very poor conductor, recombination is impeded, and the material retains or accumulates the charge.

The period for which the charge is retained is characterized by the relaxation time of the material, which is related to its conductivity: the lower the conductivity, the greater the relaxation time.

If a material has a comparatively high conductivity, the recombination of charges is very rapid, and consequently, little or no static electricity accumulates on the material. Such a highly conducting material can only retain or accumulate charge

if it is insulated by a poor conductor, and the rate of loss of charge is then dependent upon the relaxation time of this lesser conducting material.

Electrostatic breakdown between any two points, giving rise to a discharge, depends on the strength of the electrostatic field in the space between the points. A field strength of 3000 kilovolts per meter is sufficient to cause the breakdown of air or petroleum gases.

Conductors (conductivity > 50 pico Siemens/metre)

Conductors cannot hold a charge. If they are insulated, all the available charge will be instantaneously released into a discharge when an opportunity occurs.

Non-conductors (conductivity < 50 pico Siemens/metre)

Non-conductors have such low conductivity that, once they receive a charge, they retain it for a very long period.

Under normal conditions, gases are highly insulating. Charged mists are formed during the ejection of wet steam from a nozzle while using tank washing machines. Although the liquid (e.g., water) may have a very high conductivity, the relaxation on the droplets is hindered by the insulating properties of the surrounding gas.

##### Precautions

Precautions to Prevent Charge Generation:

- Keep initial loading pipeline velocity below 1 m/s until the liquid level reaches twice the diameter of the dip tube above the bottom end of the dip pipe. Max pipeline velocity should be below 7 m/s.

- Avoid using filters and bends in the lines.

- Do not pump or flow hydrocarbons with dispersed water or solids.

- Avoid splash filling.

Precautions to Prevent Charge Accumulation:

- Ensure all metal on the seaward side is electrically continuous to the ship.

- Ensure all metal on the landward side (lines, pump, tank) is electrically continuous to the jetty earthing system.

- Electrical resistance between the tank and loading arm should not exceed 10 ohms.

- Avoid flammable atmospheres inside cargo tanks

- Displace air in tank vapor space with nitrogen or inert gas.

####### Spark Discharge

Spark discharges occur between conductive objects at different voltages, usually when one of the objects is not adequately grounded.

An example would be a metal can floating on a static accumulator and the side of the tank.

Under certain circumstances, discharges with sufficient energy to ignite hydrocarbon gas/air mixtures can occur from unearthed conducting objects already within, or introduced into, a tank filled with charged mist.

Avoiding ungrounded conductive objects through design, maintenance, and operating practices can prevent this type of spark.

####### Brush discharge

Brush discharges can occur between a grounded conductive object and a charged low conductive material.

An example would be a spark between the bottom of a filling arm and the surface of the product during splash filling.

Brush discharges can be eliminated by avoiding the charge built-up on the product through adequate residence times, flow restrictions etc.

###### Loading in Non-inerted Atmosphere

The following measures should be taken to prevent electrostatic hazards:

- Keep initial pipeline velocity below 1 m/s until the liquid level reaches twice the dip tube diameter above the bottom end of the dip pipe. Max pipeline velocity should be below 7 m/s.

Note: The smallest line diameter limits the velocity, not the number of tanks.

- When loading multiple tanks, increase the rate only when all dip tubes are submerged (twice the dip tube diameter).

- Ensure velocity limits in all parts of the system, using the smallest line diameter for calculations.

- Consider different flow distributions into vessel compartments.

- Monitor loading rates at all times.

- Avoid too many bends and obstructions in the lines.

- Eliminate splash filling.

- Install electrically insulating flanges or semi-conductive hoses with a minimum resistance of 1000 ohms at the last flange on the loading and vapor return lines.

- Ensure all metal on the seaward side of the insulation flange is continuous to the ship, and all metal on the landward side is continuous to the jetty earthing system.

- Electrical resistance between the tank and loading arm should be a maximum of 10 ohms.

- Ensure receiving tanks do not contain unearthed objects that can float and cause sparks.

- Epoxy coatings in tanks impede static charge dispersal.

- More earthed metal parts in tanks facilitate faster charge dissipation (e.g., via dip tube).

- Use only nitrogen to clear lines after loading.

###### Loading Under Inert Gas/Nitrogen

The following measures should be taken to prevent electrostatic hazards:

- Inert tanks before loading and maintain an inert atmosphere during loading to eliminate fire /explosion risk from electrostatic discharge.

- Oxygen concentration in cargo tanks must be below 8% before and throughout loading.

- Loading rate restrictions for static electricity risk do not apply when using inert gas.

###### Sampling/Gauging/Dipping

The following measures should be taken to prevent electrostatic hazards:

- Use either completely conductive or non-conductive devices.

- Do not use conductive sampling and gauging devices with non-conductive lowering devices (e.g., synthetic fiber ropes).

- Non-conducting equipment with no metallic parts is acceptable, but dirt can make it conductive.

- Dip tape or sampling cages can be charged by induction if suspended via non-conductors (e.g., nylon rope).

- Non-conductive ropes can generate static charges if rapidly slipped through gloved hands.

- Man-made fibers (e.g., nylon) generate static discharges.

- Use conductive sampling and gauging devices with conductive lowering devices (e.g., tape, cable) and bond them to the tank.

- Ensure the sample can or lowering device is at the same potential as the tank wall.

- After loading, wait 30 minutes before sampling to allow charge dissipation.

- Clean, dry natural fiber ropes may be non-conductive in low humidity but should maintain contact with the tank hatch.

- Sampling and dipping through sounding pipes are permissible at any time because significant charge cannot accumulate on the liquid surface within a correctly designed and installed sounding pipe.

- When sampling/dipping inerted tanks, follow precautions if the tank remains under inert atmosphere during operations (closed sampling system).

###### Clothing

Because of its significant capacity to ground, the human body can store an amount of energy in excess of the ignition energy for common hydrocarbons.

Body potential of 10-50kV can be attained by individuals.

When handling flammable liquids wear:

- Non-conductive clothing (natural fiber).

- Antistatic shoes (maximum 10E8 Ohms resistance).

Do not use rubber mats.

Rubber mats will render the anti-static shoes ineffective.

###### Vapour Treatment

When vapor treatment is required follow below guidance:

Do not blow vapours off directly to the atmosphere. Route them to either:

The shore tank (vapour return)

A vapour treatment unit (VTU)

Ensure adequate protection against flame spread. Some VTUs may not be fully explosion-proof and are designed to work only with inert gas. In such cases, inert the vapours first.

Vapour treatment units can be:

Scrubbers

Active carbon beds

Condensers

Vapour combustion units

Avoid isolated conductive sections in a vapour recovery system. All conductive parts of the vapour connection to the ship should be in electrical contact with the cargo tank.

Liquid cascading from one compartment to another due to overfilling through the common overhead system can create electrostatic and other hazards.

If the ship is isolated from the shore with insulating flanges in the liquid line, fit an insulating flange in the vapour return line, close to the manifold.

###### Inerting and Related Hazards

Tank entry procedures must be followed in accordance with IMS Chapter 5.3.2 - Entry into Enclosed Space.

###### Ship/Shore Bonding Cables

A ship/shore bonding cable is not effective as a safety device.

If a bonding cable is insisted upon by the terminal, fit it in full compliance with ISGOTT requirements.

###### Grounding/Earthing vs. Insulating Flanges

Large currents can flow in electrically conducting pipework and flexible hose systems between ship and shore, posing a danger of incentive arcs during connection/disconnection.

Insert an insulating flange within the length of the loading arms and at the connection of flexible hose strings to the shore pipeline system. Alternatively, include one length of insulating or semi-conductive hose in each string.

Ensure the system remains earthed either to the ship or the shore.

The insulating flange or hose must have a minimum resistance of 1000 ohms. This resistance must be regularly checked. Alternatively, use an antistatic hose that conducts static electricity but not large currents.

Ensure the ship and shore are not electrically connected/disconnected where a flammable atmosphere may be present (e.g., placing/removing aluminum gangway).

###### Cargo Tanks Cleaning

Enhance safe working conditions when cleaning cargo tanks by using the following criteria:

Individual washing nozzle capacity should not exceed 17.5 m³/hr.

The nozzle diameter should not exceed 12 mm.

The nozzle and other equipment introduced in the tank must be bonded to the tank.

Hoses used for cleaning must be tested for electrical continuity, with resistance not exceeding 6 ohms per meter length.

No high-pressure jet cleaning (can cause the build-up of static charges).

Do not steam clean tanks containing a flammable atmosphere. Condensation of steam can draw in air, possibly creating an explosive atmosphere.

In a tank with non-conductive lining, charged condensate from steam can accumulate, becoming a conductive 'object' in the tank.

When using water or water-based solutions for cleaning with jets, sprays, or fog nozzles, be aware of the potential for static charge generation.

Water washings using sprays should only be conducted in an inerted or non-flammable atmosphere.

When using solvents for cleaning, inert the tank. If this is not possible, take the following measures:

Use a conductive solvent (conductivity > 50 pS/m).

Use a high-flash point material (greater than the operating temperatures).

Ensure the cleaning system is conductive and bonded to the tank.

Use a nozzle that does not create a fine mist or aerosol.

Do not displace lines with water into a tank containing a static accumulator.

##### Static Accumulator Cargoes

Typical static accumulator cargoes are:

Note: Electrical conductivity varies with temperature, composition and purity. This list is not exhausive.

All products with an electrical conductivity of less than 50pS/m are considered static accumulators



### Archive - 8.2.8 Stainless Steel Maintenance - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Stainless Steel Maintenance

###### Introduction

Stainless steel is a generic term for a group of alloys. The term "stainless" implies resistance to staining, rusting, and pitting, generally defining a chromium content between 11% and 30%. The base is iron. Other elements usually found in stainless steel are:

- Nickel: Increases corrosion resistance and strength.

- Molybdenum: Increases resistance to solutions of halogen salts and pitting in seawater.

- Nitrogen: Increases strength.

The corrosion resistance of stainless steel is due to a very thin oxide surface film that is continuous, non-porous, insoluble, and self-healing. If broken, the film repairs itself when re-exposed to air or a suitable oxidizing agent.

However, if the protective film is broken due to mechanical damage, surface imperfections, blemishes, or traces of embedded foreign material, the stainless steel will corrode like ordinary iron.

Therefore, maintaining this film is crucial for the stainless steel's "passive" (non-reactive) behaviour.

To ensure this:

- Do not use steel tools like knives, spatulas, grinders, steel wool, or steel brushes (stone grinders may be used safely).

- Do not leave seawater (salts) on the surface.

- Do not leave contaminants like grease or previous cargo residues on the surface.

- If damaged areas (pitting) are repaired by welding, always treat the repaired area by the passivity process described below.

###### Passivation

To restore the chromium oxide film when broken, follow this passivation procedure:

Step 1: Degreasing

- Remove grease, oil, paint, soil, grit, and other contaminants using hydrocarbon solvent (naphtha, etc.) or alkaline cleaners (water-based alkaline HD7B-2 from Vecom or equivalent) and a rag or fiber brush.

- Rinse with clean fresh water and dry the surfaces.

Step 2: Pickling (Acid Cleaning)

- Apply a solution of nitric and hydrofluoric acids, combined with a wetting agent or detergent, over the stainless steel surface to remove scale and metallic contamination.

- Use pickling paste or liquid by circulation, immersion, or a fiber brush.

- Leave the solution on the surface for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 12 hours.

- Rinse thoroughly with clean fresh water.

Step 3: Passivation

- Apply a solution of nitric acid and other mild constituents to promote the protective chromium oxide film.

- Leave the passivating paste or liquid on the surface for a minimum of 2 hours and a maximum of 12 hours.

- Rinse with clean fresh water.

Note: Passivation is usually done on large surfaces under the supervision of a superintendent, typically when the ship is in dry dock or alongside for repairs.

###### Precautions

- Store pickling liquid/paste in plastic containers with adequate ventilation, separate from other chemicals and paints.

- Do not use metal or glass containers.

- Wear full protective equipment:

- Chemical suit

- Rubber boots

- Rubber gloves

- Goggles

- Hard hat

- Breathing apparatus

- If working in a closed space (cargo tank), ventilate while inside.

- Ensure emergency eye wash/showers on deck are operational.

- Have "eye wash" solution readily available.

- Consult the Medical First Aid Guide (MFAG) before use for medical advice in case of an accident.

###### Material Needed

- Degreaser (if required): Hydrocarbon solvent or alkaline cleaner.

- Pickling paste/liquid (specify paste for vertical surfaces, liquid for pipes).

- Protective equipment.

- Plastic buckets.

- Fiber brushes and rags.

###### Heating Coils, Ladders, Pumps, Pump stacks

- Degrease (if needed).

- Clean coils with fresh water and dry them.

- Fill the tank with about 3 cm of freshwater to avoid damage to the bottom coating.

- Start ventilation using portable fans.

- Begin the pickling process using pickling paste and fiber brushes.

- Clean coils with fresh water and ensure all pickling paste is removed.

- Remove washings from the tank using a portable pump (e.g., Wilden pump).

- Use only the pump for chemical service (with Teflon diaphragms and stainless steel body).

###### Cargo Piping on Deck

- Degrease (if needed).

- Clean with fresh water and blow air to dry the lines.

- Fill the line with pickling liquid. Ensure the pump's hose is chemical resistant and install a blind stainless steel flange (2-3 mm thick) after the cargo pump discharge valve to prevent drainage to the cargo tank.

- Drain the pickling liquid back to plastic barrels for future use using the drain valve/cock in the manifold, adjusting the ship's trim if possible, or blowing by air.

- Clean the line with adequate fresh water.

###### IGS Scrubber (Moss Type)

- Remove filters from the scrubber unit.

- Remove high-level alarm and any other non-stainless steel fittings.

- Degrease (if needed).

- Clean with fresh water and let it dry.

- Install a fire hose inside the drain pipe of the scrubber, with the overboard valve open to avoid damage to the overboard pipe (if fiberglass) by pickling paste.

- Using a chemical spray pump (e.g., ARO type), spray pickling paste on the interior surfaces of the scrubber unit from top to bottom. Ensure the ARO pump's hose is chemical resistant.

- Upon completion, start the scrubber pump to wash off the pickling paste.

Note: Stainless steel filters may be cleaned using a hydrocarbon solvent or passivated using the ARO spray pump and pickling paste. If passivating, lay filters on a plastic sheet (to protect the deck paint) outside the engine room, preferably on the poop deck.

## 8.3 Legal and Commercial - Tankers



### 8.3.1 Commercial Guidance to Master - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Charter Employment

###### Introduction

The master shall:

- Have a copy of the charter party to fully understand what is required of the vessel.

- Inform the chief officer and chief engineer of the sections of the charter party that affect them.

- Contact the operations department without delay:

- In case of doubt as to the contents of the charter party.

- If the master feels that the vessel cannot fulfil the requirements laid down.

Note: The master shall perform the voyage as per the requirements of the governing charter party.

###### Requirements

Orders of a Charterer

Execute all instructions and directions given by a charterer correctly.

If, due to special circumstances, written instructions cannot be provided, and the master has to follow verbal orders:

- Make an entry in the deck logbook.

- Confirm the order in writing.

- Request re-confirmation in writing.

Tendering Notice of Readiness

Tender the notice of readiness strictly as per the relevant clause of the governing charter party.

If the master has any concern about the validity of a notice of readiness that he has already tendered, he should re-tender the notice of readiness on any number of occasions.

Phrase any subsequent notices of readiness as being without prejudice to preceding notices of readiness served.

Maximum Cargo Intake Whilst Under Charter

In case of differences between the ship and charterer about the maximum allowable cargo intake, assist the charterer to utilize up to 98% of the vessel's cargo tanks.

Do not carry cargo in excess of that permitted due to:

- Draught constraints

- Stability

- Stresses

- Permissible weights

- Load Line zones compliance

- Any other factor concerning the safety of the ship or cargoes

Loading Two or More Grades

Segregate two or more grades using double valve segregation. If the vessel is unable to do so and the charterer allows single valve segregation, take approval from the operations department prior to loading.

###### Charterer's Obligations

The charterer or his agents shall give the master necessary information and documentation as required, and at the time required under the charter party. This information shall allow the ship to load, stow, carry, and discharge the intended cargo safely during all stages of the voyage.

This information shall allow the vessel to fulfil requirements as per:

- International or national regulations

- Flag state regulations

- Port regulations

- Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF) guidelines

- International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals (ISGOTT) guidelines

- Charter party requirements

Inform the operations department if the charterer or their agents regularly fail to provide proper information to allow the vessel to trade safely and effectively.

##### Guidance To Master

###### Signatures

Ensure documents are properly signed by a responsible officer and a terminal or charterer’s representative.

Failure to do so may cause claims to be invalidated. If signatures are unavailable, issue a letter of protest stating “non-availability of terminal rep” or “refused to sign documents”.

###### Notice of Readiness

Always tender NOR as per the charter party terms and to the identified parties.

Tender NOR on arrival within port limits and at the usual waiting area.

If arriving before the laycan, tender NOR at the start of the laycan unless granted authority for early NOR.

Re-tender NOR without prejudice if:

- Anchoring prior to the berth after initial arrival.

- Proceeding direct to the berth from arrival or after anchoring.

- After port state control restrictions are lifted.

- Moving to multiple berths within a port upon hose disconnection.

- Ordered to anchor or drift outside the port, re-tender at the designated area and upon all fast at the berth.

If unsure about when to tender NOR, contact the operator immediately.

###### Statement of Fact

The Statement of Facts (SOF) is a critical document detailing the timings of events from a vessel’s arrival at the load/discharge port until departure.

These recorded times determine which periods of time are accounted for by the charterer and which by the owner.

Key Events and Timings:

- Notice of Readiness (NOR): The tendering of the NOR marks the start of laytime.

- Anchoring or Berthing: Record either the time of anchoring or the time the vessel is secured at the terminal. This signals the resumption of laytime. Re-tender the NOR without prejudice to the initial tendering.

- Awaiting Terminal Readiness: If the vessel does not proceed directly to the loading/discharging terminal and remains anchored or drifting, note that it is awaiting terminal readiness.

Caution:  Do not use terms like "awaiting pilot," "awaiting tide," or "awaiting daylight" as they can be misinterpreted and used to exclude demurrage claims.

- Pre-Cargo Loading Operations: Once alongside the terminal, document all pre-cargo loading activities such as the cargo surveyor’s activities, connection of shore cargo lines, sampling, and pre-transfer conferences.

- Cargo Transfer Details: Include details of the cargo transfer process: commencement, any terminal stoppages and resumptions, completion, line displacements, etc.

- Lightering Operations: For lightering operations, ensure the SOF includes timing details of fenders off, vessel separation, and the commencement of sea passage (COSP) from the lightering zone.

- End of Laytime or Demurrage: Do not rush to disconnect the cargo loading connections, as this timing is critical for ending laytime or demurrage if applicable.

###### Bills of Lading

General Overview

- Bills of Lading (B/L) should be signed by the master before departure from the load berth or port.

- The B/L is a legal document, therefor it is crucial to ensure all information is accurate.

- Check and report the correct number of original bills of lading signed (e.g., 3/3).

- B/L is a separate contract from the voyage charter party and must accurately reflect the condition and quantity of the cargo.

Key Items to verify on B/L

- B/L number

- Name of vessel and master

- Type/quantity of cargo

- Load/discharge port

- Consignee/Consignor/Notifying party / other parties

- Charter Party date

Clauses to Include in B/L

- Paramount clause

- Both to blame collision clause

- Hague or Hague-Visby rules

- York-Antwerp rules

- New Jason clause

Note: Alternatively, include - "All clauses, terms and conditions, including Arbitration clause, as per charter party dated ……………………. are incorporated herein".

Caution:

Do not sign a "clean on board" bill of lading if in doubt.

Contact the operations department for advice if uncertain about any details.

If clauses or C/P date are missing, issue a Letter of Protest (This has no legal effect against third parties).

Important Notes

- Legal Binding: The vessel is bound to deliver the cargo as described in the "clean on board" B/L.

- Financial Impact: A B/L with remarks may be rejected by financial institutions.

- Claims: "Clean on board" B/Ls and letters of protest or indemnity are not covered by P&I insurance and can result in expenses for owners.

Further Precautions

- Do not sign blank B/Ls.

- Do not sign inaccurate B/Ls or authorize others to do so.

- Do not carry original B/Ls onboard unless sealed in an envelope.

- Ensure a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) is obtained from the charterer.

- If contradictory instructions are received, refer to the operations department.

Re-issuing Bills of Lading

- Any re-issuance must be approved by the owners.

- Only one set of B/Ls should be in circulation for any cargo.

- Obtain written confirmation that all original B/Ls are in possession of the owner and destroyed before issuing new ones.

Conflicts and Discrepancies

- Contact operations department if the discharge port on the B/L conflicts with voyage orders.

- Report any discrepancy in cargo quantity (+/- 0.25% or as specified in CP) between ship and B/L figures.

- Follow instructions owner’s instructions if commercial operators orders contradict the owner's instructions.

Accuracy and Contractual Obligations

- Ensure B/L description matches the actual cargo loaded.

Note: Example - Mislabeling cargo types (e.g., Jet Fuel as Gasoline) can indicate mistakes or fraud.

- Use reasonable judgment for cargo specification and quantity.

- Report any discrepancies and seek LOI for significant differences.

Note: Discrepancies in cargo quantity on the B/L can lead to claims; obtain LOI if needed.

###### Pumping Logs

Almost all charter parties require the vessel to either discharge all cargo within 24 hours or maintain 100 PSI at the ship’s rail.

If terminal restrictions prevent compliance with above requirement, record this on the pumping log.

- Ensure logs are complete and accurate with entries for every hour of discharge.

- Note periods when the vessel is stripping.

- A terminal representative must sign the pumping log. If they refuse, issue a letter of protest (LOP).

- Document any terminal-caused problems in writing.

- The LOP is crucial for demurrage claims, therefore ensure due diligence to details.

- Register normal pressure variations during discharge, especially at startup and during stripping operations.

###### Deadfreight

- The master must issue a declaration of loadable quantity in writing before loading to justify deadfreight if charterers fail to provide the requested cargo.

- Most charter parties specify a range of cargo quantities, allowing flexibility for the master to determine the precise loadable quantity within set limits.

- Once the master declares the required cargo amount, it becomes the contractual quantity, replacing the original charter party option.

- The declaration should be made in writing and included in the notice of readiness.

- For deadweight cargoes, declare the maximum loadable quantity consistent with the vessel’s loadline.

- For capacity cargoes, base the maximum cargo quantity on an approximate density, subject to adjustment once accurate density is known.

- File a final cargo declaration adjusting the maximum quantity when accurate cargo density is known.

###### Heating Logs

- Maintain a log showing daily cargo temperature and IFO/MDO consumed for heating whenever heating cargo.

- The industry standard requires maintaining the loaded temperature throughout the voyage and discharge, with specific instructions provided by operators.

- Bunkers used for maintaining temperature are for the pool account and shall be accurately recorded. Fuel used to increase temperature for discharge is usually reimbursed.

- Separate fuel consumption for maintaining cargo temperature and raising temperature, providing your best estimate.

- Both the master and chief engineer must sign all heating logs.

###### Letter of Indemnity (LOI)

Cargo should never be discharged unless an original B/L (endorsed by the receiver) is presented or an acceptable LOI is received from the charterer.

If an original B/L is unavailable at the discharge port, discharge the cargo against LOI.

The charterer will typically send the LOI to the office for review or to the head owner for approval. Once approved, confirmation to discharge cargo will be given by the operations department.

Some charter parties include an LOI invocation clause, making a formal LOI unnecessary.

##### Automated Manifest System

###### Introduction

Every shipping company has an international carrier bond (ICB) in place with U.S. Customs. This bond is valid for all U.S. ports, and the number is 18C001FIN for Reederei Nord B.V.

There is also a unique 4-letter code (Standard Alpha Carrier Code) to identify each shipping company. The SCAC code for Reederei Nord B.V. is RNBV.

Enter this SCAC code into bills of lading for cargoes bound for U.S. ports.

Vessels on period charter or vessels engaged in the transshipment of cargo from offshore U.S. to U.S. ports should contact the operations department to clarify which SCAC code to use.

###### Responsibilities

The master shall:

- Provide the required information to the agent and the charterer for filing the automated manifest system (AMS).

###### Filing Automated Manifest System - USA

If bound for U.S. ports, send cargo manifests electronically in advance using the automated manifest system (AMS).

MID-GULF SHIPPING COMPANY, INC. has been appointed as an agent in the U.S.A for filing the AMS requirements once they are received from the vessel.

The automated manifest system information requirement form TANK 29 explains how the information should be sent.

Send the completed form TANK 29 by e-mail to MID-GULF SHIPPING COMPANY, INC. AMS service centre as soon as possible after receiving the bills of lading for cargo loaded at all non-U.S. ports.

Send a separate form for each parcel loaded (Bill of Lading) for the U.S., with details completed, to:

MID-GULF SHIPPING COMPANY INC. at compliance@midship.net as soon as possible after departure.

Copy the charterer

Copy Reederei Nord operations department

Note: The subject line should contain the following:

Attn: AMS Desk – (Vessel’s name) – (Name of load port)

Each bill of lading will have a unique number that should appear as follows:

RNBV P3LK9 220614 1 (example)

RNBV XXXXX DDMMYY N

Where:

RNBV - is the company carrier code

XXXXX - is the vessel’s call sign

DDMMYY - is the date/month/year

N - is the sequence number

1 - is the sequence number for the day, which goes from 1-9, where 1 is the first B/L issued for that day. If more than 9 B/Ls are issued, the sequence starts again with the next day’s date entered.

Note: Use the AMS form TANK 29A when landing spare parts or items ashore in the USA.

####### Instructions

Obtain the information used to complete the form directly from the bill of lading.

Complete one form for each bill of lading issued.

Complete only the green shaded areas.

AMS SECTION 4 - SHIPPER/CONSIGNEE/NOTIFY PARTY

Check for the following information on the bill of lading. Contact the charterers for detailed addresses.

SHIPPER: Enter the complete name and mailing address.

CONSIGNEE/NOTIFY PARTY: If details for these two fields are available, complete the fields. However, at a minimum, one of these fields must be completed and contain the complete name and mailing address.

“To the order of” is only acceptable for the consignee or the notify party, not both.

AMS SECTION 5 - CARGO DESCRIPTION

Use the exact cargo name/description as listed in the bill of lading.

###### Specific to USA

In the event of an oil spill in U.S. waters, the master should not use oil-dispersant over-side unless instructed by the USCG and Local Port Authority.

Vessels trading in U.S. waters will, in addition to their SOPEP, carry a USCG-approved Vessel Response Plan (VRP).

Masters shall follow the procedures in this plan if an oil spill occurs in U.S. waters. Further information can be found in the SOPEP and Masters Guide to compliance in the U.S., Canada, and Panama.

OPA90 VRP requires that the company’s Oil Spill Response Organization (OSRO) is notified of all calls to the USA so that suitable spill response cover is in place, and if necessary, Average Most Probable Discharge (AMPD) coverage for lightering operations is arranged.

The Master is responsible for contacting the OSRO and advising them through the voyage notification process that AMPD coverage is needed.

Lightering operations will not commence until the USCG is notified that the AMPD coverage is in place.

Use the pro-forma provided by our OSRO contractor to notify them of calls to the USA.

Masters will also need to indicate whether AMPD for lightering operations is required for vessel-to-vessel transfers within 12 nautical miles of the U.S. coast.

Send the forms by email or fax.

Note: Masters shall ensure they receive a positive acknowledgment from the OSRO.

VLCCs using designated offshore lightering zones do not require AMPD.

If in doubt, check with the agent or the office.

Masters must also note the statutory voyage notifications to the Qualified Individual (QI).

Information is provided in ship’s specific Vessel Response Plan (VRP).

##### Principles of Marine Insurance

###### Introduction

The fundamental principles of Marine Insurance are derived from the Marine Insurance Act, 1963. These principles include Indemnity, Insurable Interest, Utmost Good Faith, Proximate Cause, Subrogation, and Contribution.

###### Basic Terms

####### Deductibles

Deductibles are amounts payable by the insured up to a ceiling in the event of a loss.

They are typically used to discourage small claims, which are disproportionately expensive to handle.

The applicable deductibles are listed under each insurance cover below.

Warranties

Warranties are conditions that we undertake to always meet.

These are divided into Express and Implied warranties.

Implied Warranties include:

- Seaworthiness

- No intentional change in destination

- No delay in voyage

- No deviation from the common route

- Duty of disclosure

- Alteration of risks

Express Warranties are explicitly stated in the insurance policy, such as trading area restrictions or not calling at areas where war risks may exist.

Risks

Marine Perils or risks are those risks incidental to the navigation of the seas.

These include:

- Perils of the sea

- War

- Fire

- Pirates

- Jettison

- Barratry (serious misconduct by crew against the vessel’s owner's interests)

- Explosion

The policy covers loss caused only by the insured perils.

###### Summary of Insurance Covers

####### Hull & Machinery Insurance

Hull & Machinery insurance covers damage to the hull, machinery, and equipment.

This insurance protects owners against partial loss, total loss, ship’s proportion of general average, salvage charges, and sue & labour expenses.

It also covers liabilities to third parties, such as collision liability and liabilities for striking fixed or floating objects.

####### Protection & Indemnity (P&I)

P&I insurance covers our legal and contractual liabilities in relation to third parties incurred during the operation of a ship.

These liabilities may concern people, cargo, pollution, etc.

Examples include liabilities arising from:

- Injury

- Illness

- Death and subsequent repatriation of crew

- Stowaways

- Life salvage

- Cargo claims

- Pollution

- Fines

- Confiscation

####### War Risk

This insurance covers damage due to acts of war and marine terrorism perils normally excluded from other marine policies.

There is no deductible for claims under this cover.

####### Delay

This cover reimburses costs incurred due to unforeseen delays on board or ashore.

Shore side perils include:

- Strikes

- Lockouts

- Rebellions

- Riots

- Political unrests

- Fires

- Explosions

- Breakdowns on land

- Storms

- Earthquakes

- Volcanic eruptions

- Partial or total closure of ports ordered by authorities

Ship side perils include:

- Delays due to breakdown of machinery

- Pollution

- Crew strikes

- Crew crimes

- Quarantine

Deductibles vary between nil to 8 days, depending on the cause and duration of the delay.

####### Drugs & Deviation Cover

This cover includes liabilities and expenses incurred if the vessel is seized or delayed due to the discovery of drugs or deviation due to passengers, crew, cyberattack, or search and rescue at sea.

####### Special Risks

This cover includes expenses incurred if a vessel is hijacked or crew kidnapped for ransom, such as crisis risk consultants, legal liability, ransom payment, and injuries due to the event.

No deductible is applied for claims under this cover.

####### FD&D (Freight Demurrage & Defence)

FD&D insurance covers legal and associated costs in disputes arising from owning and operating the vessel.

The insurance covers costs incurred in recovering the amount in dispute, including legal fees, surveyor's fees, and expert's fees, but does not insure the disputed sum itself.

####### Directors and Officers Errors and Omission Insurance (D&O/E&O)

This insurance covers claims arising from mistakes, negligence, fraudulent performance by employees, loss of documents, liabilities due to breach of warranties, and liabilities for libel and slander.

Charterers Liabilities

This cover protects against third-party liabilities that the pool is exposed to by managing the assets of the head owners.

The liabilities may arise from several perils, potentially covered by the head owners' insurance but for which the pool is held partially or fully liable.

####### Transport

This covers goods transported to/from the vessels, such as spares and stores.



### 8.3.2 Letters of Protest - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Letters of Protest

###### Introduction

Cargo contaminations/shortages, operational failures/delays, and contractual disputes may result in substantial claims to owners.

It is crucial to alert owners promptly and arrange legal assistance and P&I attendance to mitigate risks. Claims from third parties, including charterers, receivers, operators, or terminals, may take months to surface.

Therefore, the Master should promptly alert all interested parties, including owners, and lodge a Letter of Protest (LOP) whenever there is a possibility of any claim.

- LOP is always addressed to a named party or person.

- It serves to record a disagreement with another party, holding them responsible for any legal or financial consequences arising from the matter complained about.

- In some jurisdictions, a LOP requires being sworn before a court of law or a notary public. If this situation arises, the Master should contact the office and/or local P&I.

The Company provided standard LOP templates to assist the Master.

If the Master receives a LOP, they shall inform the office and sign “For receipt only without prejudice or admission of liability.”

###### Letters of Protest Guidelines

The Master shall protect the owner’s interests by protesting when necessary:

####### At Loading Port

- Late acceptance of NOR.

- Unsafe berth.

- Delays to the vessel, including:

- Awaiting berth.

- Terminal restrictions (limiting pressure, rates, connections, etc.)

- Customs or immigration clearance.

- Pilot(s) or tug(s).

- Orders to start loading/discharging.

- Daylight restriction delays.

- Awaiting cargo documents.

- Others.

- Late issuance of free pratique.

Note:    If Free Pratique is not granted at the time of tendering NOR, issue a notice of protest (NOP) to the port authority and terminal.

- Insufficient shore connections.

- Quality of cargo.

- Free-water in cargo.

- Insufficient time for free-water to settle.

- Ship/shore quantity difference.

Note:    Issue protest for any difference, however small.

If the difference exceeds 0.25% (after applying V.E.F.), the Master shall:

Ask the terminal to re-check their calculations.

Instruct the chief officer to re-check ship's figures.

Contact the operator if discrepancies are confirmed.

- Cargo temperature deviations.

- Shore stoppages.

- Slow loading rate.

Note: If less than requested by the vessel.

- Short loading or overloading by shore.

Note: If the cargo nomination was not supplied in full or was exceeded.

Note:   Assigned codes must be reported to US Customs at least 24 hours prior to arrival at the discharge port.

- Use of different ASTM tables for calculation.

- Failure to provide cargo representative samples.

- Refusal to sign vessel’s documents.``

Note: If a terminal issues a letter of protest against the vessel, the Master should return an acknowledgment “for receipt only”. Follow-up actions depend on the protest's nature and the Master’s judgment. Inform the company immediately for further advice and guidance.

####### At Discharge Port

- Late acceptance of NOR.

- Delays to the vessel.

- Late issuance of free pratique.

- Insufficient shore connections.

- Shore restrictions (rate and pressure).

- Shore stoppages.

- Use of different ASTM tables for calculation.

- Ship/shore out-turn quantity difference.

Note: Do not sign any confirmation on out-turn figures.

- Restrictions imposed by the discharge terminal.

- Restrictions for crude oil washing at the discharge terminal.

- Measuring difficulties due to weather/sea conditions.

- Failure to provide a discharge certificate/cargo receipt.

Note: Use the company format for discharge certificate/cargo receipt.

###### Note of Protest or Sea Protest

A Note of Protest (NOP) is a solemn declaration by a Ship’s Master that circumstances beyond their control have or may have caused damage to the ship or its cargo or necessitated actions that may render owners liable to legal action by another party.

Generally addressed as “To Whomsoever It May Concern,” an NOP must be made before a notary public, magistrate, consular officer, or other authority.

Issue a NOP when:

- During the voyage, the ship has encountered conditions of wind and sea which may result in damage to cargo.

- The ship is damaged or there is a reason to fear that damage may be sustained.

- Through the stress of weather, it has not been practicable to adopt normal precautions.

- The cargo is shipped in such a condition that it is likely to suffer deterioration during the voyage.

- Any serious break of charter party terms is committed by the charterer or his agent (eg. unduly delaying loading, refusal to pay demurrage or refusal to accept B/L in the form signed by Master)

- Consignee fails to discharge cargo or take delivery thereof and pay the freight in accordance with the charter party of B/L terms.

- In all cases of General Average.

Protests should be noted within 24 hours of arrival in port and before cargo removal, in whole or part. There is no provision for the recipient’s signature.

Supporting documents required for an NOP include:

- Deck Logbook pages.

- Official Logbook pages.

- Weather Reports.

- Any picture evidence.

####### Extended Protest

At the time of noting protest, the Master should reserve the right to extend it.

An extended protest should be made when relevant facts have come to light, as it is impossible to ascertain the full extent of loss or damage at the time of noting protest.



### 8.3.3 Shortage and Contamination Claims - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Shortage Claims

Oil shortage claims generally arise from discrepancies between the bill of lading's stated cargo quantity and the out-turn quantity determined by the receivers at the discharge port.

Both figures often come from shore-tank or meter-measured data.

Common arguments supporting the shipper/receiver's case include:

- The ship is bound by the figure stated in the bill of lading.

- Shore tank calibrations are more accurate than the ship's tank calibrations.

- Oil contamination by water post-loading.

- Some oil remains on board the ship.

The owner's defense typically asserts:

- The discharged cargo quantity is comparable to the loaded quantity.

- No significant in-transit loss occurred.

- Any on-board quantity (OBQ) prior to loading has been considered.

- All cargo has been discharged with nothing remaining on board (nil ROB).

The chief officer and the attending surveyor shall check for inconsistencies in calculations, verifying all possible causes for quantity differences, rechecking drafts, trim, cargo/ballast tank soundings, cargo temperatures, and VEF calculations.

###### Measurement Accuracy

The Master shall:

- Decline to sign the bills of lading if there is a difference between the bill of lading figure and the ship's figure (refer to Charter Party and owners instructions).

- Insist on thorough checks of all measurements and calculations, both on board and ashore.

Measurements of shore tanks before loading cannot be verified once cargo has been transferred, making shore figures' accuracy dependent on the terminal's records.

Investigation usually reduces discrepancies to acceptable figures.

Reasons for gross inaccuracies may include:

- Wrongly measured ullages.

- Unaccounted for filled tanks.

- No allowance for pipeline contents.

- Incorrect temperatures or densities.

- Cargo loaded on top.

- Cargo retained in the shore installation.

###### Trim/Sea Factor

Ullaging is best carried out when the ship is on an even keel, as errors may be introduced when applying trim corrections.

A ship afloat, whether alongside a jetty, at anchor, or at sea, is a moving platform, and even slight movements may affect measurement accuracy.

###### Residues in Tanks

Residues on tank bottom and internal structures can affect the accuracy of on-board quantity measurements.

Residue quantities vary with the vessel's age and cargo types.

Dips recorded to determine ROB or OBQ are often taken when the vessel's trim renders the ullage tape not perpendicular to the tank bottom, leading to inaccurate readings.

Crude oil washing (COW) reduces clinkage with most crudes, but some types of crude can increase it, if COW is carried out. Refer to COW Manual.

###### Water

Water-finding paste on interface tapes or sounding rods does not accurately distinguish between free water and emulsion.

After fast loading, there may not be sufficient time for water in the cargo to settle out, leading to inaccurate water dips taken immediately after loading.

Issue a Letter of Protest to Load Terminal/Shippers for lack of sufficient time allowed for free water to settle.

Take water dips 24 hours after departure from load port and again before arrival at the discharge port. Inform the charterer and operations department if free water is significant.

###### Thermometers

Significant temperature variations can develop between cargo tanks during the voyage.

Calculate the quantity based on individual tank temperatures.

Using the average temperature for the whole ship is inaccurate and can lead to significant loss.

###### API Gravity/Density/Samples

Cargo quantities are calculated based on the API gravity or density provided by the terminal, determined by laboratory analysis of samples.

Samples taken from the shore pipeline may not be representative of the loaded cargo.

In addition to surveyor sampling, vessel personnel shall follow the on-board sampling procedure given in IMS Chapter 8.1.1 – General Tanker Practices.

###### Trade Allowance

Studies by major oil companies indicate measurement errors of plus or minus 0.21% for volume calculations and 0.25% for weight calculations.

These measurement errors typically account for a trade allowance of 0.5%.

Note: Master shall comply with charterers and owners instruction regarding cargo quantity difference when signing the Bill of Lading.

###### Ship's Experience Factor

After calculating the ship's figures, the terminal provides the shore figure, which appears on the bill of lading.

Discrepancies between shore and ship figures are usually minor, allowing for bill of lading signing. Always compare gross standard figures, considering the ship's experience factor.

###### Cargo Loaded from 'Live' Tanks

If discrepancies remain after exhaustive checks, the Master shall decline to sign clean bills of lading and seek instructions from the operations department, which may require charterers to provide a letter of indemnity before authorizing the Master to sign.

It is essential to maintain a complete documentary record of cargo operations for defense against possible cargo claims.

###### Claims during Loading and Discharge Operations

####### Record Keeping

- Maintain records of all oil transfers, including loading, discharging, internal transfers, and bunkering operations.

- These records help defend against shortage and contamination claims and handle performance claims, demurrage, and dispatch disputes.

- Keep full records of bunker quantities and maintain the oil record book properly.

####### Internal Transfers

- Avoid internal transfer of cargo unless absolutely necessary, as differences between ullages after loading and at the end of the voyage can lead to disputes.

- If internal transfers are necessary, prepare a plan to safeguard the vessel’s stress and stability.

- Report the plan, accompanied by stress and stability calculations, to the office in advance, explaining the reasons and circumstances, and request office agreement.

- Record every internal transfer in the oil record book.

- Internal transfer of cargo during an emergency should be avoided without the advice of the SERS (emergency services) that carry out damage stability calculations.

####### Vessel's Responsibility

- The vessel's responsibility begins and ends at the ship's manifold.

- Owners have no liability for measurements taken once the cargo has left the vessel.

- Claims often rely on shore outturn figures, which can be inaccurate.

- Effective stripping of the tanks is crucial, as claims will be made for any cargo remaining on board.

####### Remaining On Board Quantity

Minimize cargo ROB on completion of discharge by:

- Keeping a good stern trim.

- Properly cleaning and preparing tanks before loading.

- Maintaining the ship's pumps and pipelines in sound condition.

Heavy or heated cargoes may have clinkage and residual sediment. Crude oil washing can minimize ROB for most crude oil cargoes.

Ensure that the ship's valves, lines, and pumps are in good condition at discharge time for pumpability relevance.

For any liquid ROB, determine if it was reachable and pumpable by the vessel's equipment.

####### Handling ROB Claims

- Contact local P&I surveyor and notify the operations department if obtaining a suitable ROB certificate is difficult.

- If vessel is requested to sail before the surveyor attends, the master should protest to the receivers and their surveyor.

- If surveyors do not certify cargo as un-pumpable/unreachable, invite them to inspect the ship's pumps.

- Inform the receivers that if the cargo is considered pumpable, the ship will continue attempting to pump it until the P&I surveyor arrives.

- Maintain records for cargo pumps in case of disputes.

- Surveyors certifying cargo as pumpable must prove they have assessed the cargo's physical characteristics and its accessibility to the cargo pumps.

####### Potential ROB Claim Causes

- Alleged inadequacy of the vessel's cargo heating capability, often coupled with low ambient temperatures at discharge.

- Physical properties of a particular crude causing pumping difficulties.

- Accumulation of sediment or scale in cargo tanks restricts the free flow of oil.

- Trim restrictions at the berth.

- Assumed poor condition of vessel’s pumping equipment.

####### Issuing ROB Certificates

- After discharge, an ROB certificate should be signed by an appropriate shore representative, ideally describing any remaining cargo as un-pumpable residue.

- Shore cargo inspectors may prefer the term "liquid/non-liquid," which is unsatisfactory and should be rejected if possible.

Note: The term "liquid/non-liquid" allows cargo owners to claim un-pumpability and activate a charter party retention clause if it requires the cargo to be pumpable.

Prepare the required documents in advance to avoid delays.

Issue a Letter of Protest (LOP) if there are delays from shore.

##### Contamination Claims

###### Introduction

Many oil shortage claims arise from the presence of excessive water found in crude oil cargoes at the discharge port, settling out during the voyage.

Crude oil cargoes are often blended before refining, and contamination would need to be substantial for any claim.

Contamination claims can occur with petroleum products but rarely with crude oil.

Adding salt or fresh water to most crude oils generally causes minimal issues in refining.

Modern refineries, designed to handle crude oils transported by sea, include desalination facilities that protect equipment from corrosion.

Sources of Contamination

- Residues of previous cargoes and their odor in tanks.

- Water and moisture.

- Chlorides from seawater in tanks.

- Inter-tank leakages or leakages through common piping/valve systems.

- Heating coil/heater leakages.

- Hydraulic oil leakages.

- Vapor contamination due to common venting systems.

###### Procedures at the Start of Loading

Ship’s crew, under a designated officer’s supervision and in the presence of an Independent Surveyor and Loading Master (if possible), shall draw samples from the initial cargo flowing at the manifold.

The officer should know the expected cargo appearance and follow below steps if deviations are noticed:

    - Chief Officer shall:

- STOP the operation IMMEDIATELY if the first flow of cargo is not as expected.

- Close all tank valves and manifolds, keeping the contaminant in the cargo lines.

- Inform the Master.

- Label and record the samples, noting the port of loading, date, time, operation status, sample source, expected grade, and signatures of the responsible officer, Independent Surveyor, and shore representative.

    - Master shall:

- Inform the Owner and Charterer immediately.

- Request P&I assistance if advised by the Owner.

- Issue a LOP holding the Terminal responsible for costs and delays.

- Follow Owner’s further orders.

DO NOT resume the cargo operation unless directed by the Owner.

###### Sample Collection and Retention

- Take first flow samples from the manifold each time the loading commences, resumes after an interruption, shore tanks are changed, the ship re-berths, or a new manifold is connected.

- Retain manifold first flow samples for two years.

- Routinely take ship’s samples from cargo tanks, labeling them correctly.

- Ensure a designated officer witnesses sample collection by the Independent Surveyor, ensuring labels match the samples drawn.

- Receive two sample sets from the Surveyor: one for the receiver and one for the ship, providing a receipt marked “For receipt only”.

###### Actions in Case of Contamination

First Foot Failure:

- Analyze cargo to identify contaminants.

- Transfer contaminated cargo to the tank with the worst results and discharge ashore.

- Prepare emptied tanks per commercial requirements.

- Do not mix several grades of contaminated cargo.

Contamination from Heating Systems:

- Isolate the heating line, preventing cargo from entering the engine room/boiler.

- Clean the entire heating system with appropriate PPE.

- Treat all contaminated water per MARPOL requirements.

Contamination from Hydraulic Oil (FRAMO systems): Isolate the pump from the hydraulic system and purge the cofferdam.

Inter-tank Transfer: Confirm cleanliness and suitability of tanks before transfer. Consider deviating to the nearest port if transfer is not possible, in consultation with the Office.

###### Segregation and Contamination Prevention

- Avoid admixture of cargo grades. The cargo layout must conform to vessel cargo, venting, and inert gas line system limitations.

- A segregation is a group of tanks served by separate lines and a pump. Maintain two-valve segregation between grades at all times.

- At least two-valve segregation between different grades.

- Single valve segregation is acceptable for compatible grades if:

- Linked valves have been inspected/tested and their integrity assured.

- The charterer’s consent and instructions are provided.

- The company’s consent is sent to the vessel.

- Isolate individual tanks IG inlets to prevent vapor contamination.



### 8.3.4 Insurance and Claims - rev 0 issued 04.12.2024

##### Marine Insurance and Claims

###### Introduction

This document provides instructions on meeting insurance requirements during onboard casualties.

It applies to all vessels under Reederei Nord management and covers evidence preservation onboard, not claims handling or evidence preparation ashore.

Marine insurance includes two types of coverage to protect ship owners from financial losses due to casualties:

Hull and Machinery (H&M)

Protection and Indemnity (P&I)

The Insurance Department is the vessel's primary shore contact for marine insurance and claims, with support from the Safety Department.

Marine casualties result in marine claims.

Claims are either enforced (own claims: “H&M”) or defended (third-party claims: “P&I”).

Marine insurance provides coverage for these claims.

Refer to "The Master's Role in Collecting Evidence" booklet as an excellent guide for deciding whether a claim can be made and what information is needed as secure and detailed evidence.

###### Basic Terms

Deductibles
The amount payable by the insured up to a ceiling in the event of a loss, used to discourage small claims.

Warranties
Conditions that must always be met, divided into express and implied warranties.

Implied warranties crucial in marine insurance include:

Seaworthiness

No intentional change in destination

No delay in voyage

No deviation from the common route

Duty of disclosure

Alteration of risks

Express warranties are explicitly stated in the insurance policy, such as trading areas or avoiding areas with war risks.

Risks
Marine perils or risks incidental to sea navigation, including:

Perils of the sea

War

Fire

Pirates

Jettison

Barratry (serious misconduct by crew against vessel’s owners' interests)

Explosion

The policy covers loss caused only by the insured perils.

###### Summary of Insurance Covers

Hull & Machinery Insurance
Covers physical damage to the ship (hull) and onboard equipment (machinery), including engines, cargo handling gear, and navigation equipment.

It protects against partial loss, total loss, the ship’s proportion of general average, salvage charges, and sue & labour expenses. It also covers liabilities to third parties, such as collisions and striking fixed or floating objects.

Conditions that change the risk and require informing insurers:

Docking or slipping with cargo

Unusual towage or being rowed, except in distress

Exceeding agreed trade limits

Transshipment on the high seas

Waiver of recourse in time charter parties beyond the usual extent

Using the ship in military manoeuvres

Protection & Indemnity (P&I)

Covers legal and contractual liabilities to third parties during ship operation, including:

- Injury

- Illness

- Death and subsequent repatriation of crew

- Stowaways

- Life salvage

- Cargo claims

- Pollution

- Fines

- Confiscation

###### Reporting of Marine Claims

Masters must immediately report any incident or any accident to the relevant departments (Safety, Technical, Operations, Insurance, or Personnel).

The office staff will evaluate and decide if a loss or damage becomes a claim against underwriters, charterers, or any other third party.

Effective claims handling involves:

Providing physical assistance and securing evidence

Quick reporting to the owners to notify marine insurance

Quick reporting by owners to marine insurance providers

Note: Any delay in reporting can discharge underwriters from providing coverage.

Claims response and assistance can be obtained from “local P&I correspondents” who can also help appoint surveyors for H&M claims.

In case of personal injury, environmental pollution, or imminent total loss of the vessel, the Master must contact the office first to involve local experts.

###### General Advice on Securing Evidence

Collect detailed evidence on the damages and losses by:

Retaining written records regularly created onboard (e.g., logbook, bell book)

Filing Master’s and crew’s Statements of Facts (SOF) or Letters of Protest (LOP)

Note: SOF should contain only facts, no opinions. The Master’s personal view should be reported in a confidential letter.

Take photographs and videos, labelling them with:

Date and time taken

Persons involved

Property damaged

Area concerned

Preserve Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) data, retain and seal damaged equipment or parts, paint residues, and cargo samples.

Collect statements from eyewitnesses, noting their names, addresses, and contact details.

File work reports from service engineers and arrange for an independent expert survey.

Logbooks are major evidence and inspected by owners, charterers, and third parties.

If an incorrect entry is made, draw a single line through the passage without erasing or using correcting fluid.

Purpose of LOP:

Recording disagreement with another party (e.g., rough handling of cargo by stevedores)

Reporting a specific event (e.g., heavy weather)

Note: In some port state jurisdictions, a LOP must be sworn before a court or notary public. Contact the office or local P&I if this arises.

A protest received from a third party should be claused “for receipt only, without prejudice or admission of liability.”

Master should not sign any statement prepared by a third party following a casualty without the clause.

Note: VHF communication after a major accident must be precise. Conversations are recorded and may be used in investigations and legal proceedings.

###### Access to Vessel

Casualties attract attention from potential claimants. Access to the vessel should be granted only with owner’s permission and in accordance with vessel’s Ship Security Plan (SSP).

Authorized Access:

Authorities, ambulance, police, etc., with proper identification

Personnel acting for and on behalf of owners or the office

Important:

Clarify if individuals demanding access represent owners’ P&I or charterers’ P&I.

Verify individuals claiming to represent P&I with the office before granting access.

Do not talk to anyone unless authorized by the office/owners or their marine insurers.

Accompany all individuals allowed access to the vessel, preferably by an officer or surveyor.

Do not show or hand out documents to unauthorized individuals.

Refer media representatives to the office.

Do not admit liability on behalf of owners, vessel, or crew without authorization.

Communicate only safety-related data via VHF after an accident.

Do not discuss casualty details on the bridge as discussions might be recorded by VDR.

Do not provide casualty details via private email or social media.

Do not state the cause of casualties in the logbook; only enter basic nautical data.

Do not make corrections or recordings in the sea chart after a casualty.

Do not produce statements without owners’ assistance; make brief notes and keep them private.

Refer officials to owners for statements and do not make oral statements to officials.

Do not release documents to third parties without owners’ consent.

Do not communicate with the press; refer them to owners.

Do not allow unauthorized third parties to move around the vessel without an officer present.

Before giving any verbal or written information about an incident, ensure it protects owners’ interests.

Keep a list of documents handed over and inform the office accordingly.

Carefully evaluate all reports and logbook entries before sharing them.

When deciding whether a claim can be made, refer to the handbook "The Mariner's Role in Collecting Evidence" for extensive guidance.

##### H&M: Special Advice on Securing of Evidences

###### Breakdown of Machinery and / or Cargo Gear

A marine surveyor appointed by H&M insurance will board to secure the following documents as evidence for damaged machinery:

Maintenance records of the damaged item

Lubrication records of the damaged item

Note: These are the most crucial documents for H&M claims. Ensure these items are secured, checked, and verified with the office first.

Additionally, H&M insurance will request:

Service Engineers’ work report

Engine logbook copies

Statement of Facts (SOF) by Chief Engineer

Classification record

Repair workshop quotations

Working sheet covering casualty-related crew overtime (if any)

###### Contact Damage Caused by Tugs/Barges

Similar procedures as for stevedore and shore gang damages apply. Additionally, preserve the following:

Photographs of damaged items showing accurate dimensions

Witness statements from all crewmembers and/or other witnesses

Working sheet covering casualty-related crew overtime (if any)

VDR data

Paint residues attached to the vessel’s hull left by the barge/tug; secured by an independent surveyor, sealed, and sent to RN

###### Damage to Fixed and Floating Objects (FFO)

If the owner or operators of the damaged property hold the vessel liable, they may request the master to admit liability by signing a letter.

Caution: Do not sign any letter without consulting the operations department and adding: "FOR RECEIPT ONLY. WITHOUT ADMISSION OF LIABILITY"

Make a proper entry in the vessel's deck logbook in consultation with the office and P&I.

Send information about the damage, including marked drawings and photographs, to the office or provide them to the attending P&I surveyor.

FFO damages can occur from:

Contact by or striking the vessel during manoeuvring and/or berthing

Contact with the vessel’s anchor or mooring lines

Wash damage

Master’s focus for evidence preservation should include:

Evidence of pre-existing damages (pre-damages) to the object, as owners are entitled to deduct repair costs of pre-damages from actual liability.

Note: Pre-damages often show signs of oxidation or marine growth.

Preserve evidence as follows:

SOF with full details of the damaged object

Description of the object's condition (old/new, well-used, well-illuminated, marked)

Photographs showing both old and new damages

Draw marine surveyor’s attention to pre-damage

Paint residues secured by a marine surveyor, sealed, and sent to the office

Secure VDR data

Make a proper logbook entry and advise owners and the nearest P&I correspondent

Fill out a damage report

###### Collision between Vessels

Various parties will board following a collision to secure documents. Preserve the following items immediately after a collision:

VDR data (radar systems, AIS, engine, and course loggers).

Note: Save records quickly as systems may store data for as little as 24 hours.

Voyage (passage) plan

ECDIS data

Record of true courses steered for four (4) hours before collision

Record exact time and position of the casualty using multiple methods (GPS, radar, visual bearings)

SOF shall include:

Last position fix before sighting the other ship

First observation of the other ship (visual, radar, ARPA)

Time, distance, and bearing

Lights and shapes observed, aspect, apparent course, apparent speed

Position, course, and speed of own ship at first observation

Actions taken by own ship at first observation

Subsequent facts to be recorded:

Time, distance, and bearing

Other lights and shapes observed before the collision

Steps taken to plot the other ship (formal plot)

Actions of both ships, including times up to the collision and engine movements

Sound signals made and heard with timestamps

Communication between ships before collision (light signals, VHF communications)

Traffic services (VTS) involvement

Time of collision, verifying clock accuracy on the bridge, in the engine room, and among witnesses

Position of collision and how it was obtained

Speed and angle of impact, witness records of ship’s speed and heading, and relative angle at impact, supported by photographs and drawings

Parts of the ship first in contact

Heading of own ship at collision (marked on the course recorder)

Draught of own ship at collision

Actions taken after collision

Movements of both ships after collision

Communication after collision

Other ships in the vicinity and communication with them during the collision

The following is an example of a letter that can be used in a collision incident:

This is to hold you, on behalf of my owners and as master of the vessel.......... (name) of........(P.O.R) formally responsible for all damage done to my ship resulting from the collision which took place on........ (date) with your vessel............ (name) as well as for all consequences thereof. I also invite you to appoint a surveyor to ascertain the extent of the damage to my ship as soon as possible. The total extent of the damage can only be ascertained during an extensive survey. I therefore reserve my right to claim additional damages specified therein.

###### Damages whilst transiting the Panama Canal, Suez Canal or the St. Lawrence Seaway

Masters must advise the canal authorities immediately after an incident occur in any of the above locations.

Neither authority will accept any claim for damages unless a survey is held before leaving the area.

###### Grounding

If the vessel can refloat and continue sailing with class approval, two claim areas arise:

1. Compensation for Bottom Damages and Refloating Costs by H&M Insurance

The following evidence must be preserved by the Master for the Owners' claim:

VDR records

Divers' underwater survey

Records of soundings

Value of ground reaction force

Crankshaft deflections for the main engine, taken and compared with previous records, before using the main engine post-grounding

Records of agreements with towage providers

Emergency Report Service Reports from Class Providers

The following shall be considered in case of grounding incident:

- Assess bottom damages immediately after the casualty without delay.

- H&M insurance will look for evidence of old bottom damages to exclude them from the claim.

- Ensure divers do not minimize new damages by attributing them to old damages or previous groundings.

- Any towage use without office verification should be on commercial terms and under a written agreement.

- Avoid Lloyds Open Form (LOF) unless to prevent loss of life, environmental damage, or total vessel loss.

- Activate Emergency Response Service (ERS) early in an incident via the dedicated line for stability and strength calculations.

######## 2. Charterers' Claims for Delayed Delivery of Cargo

If Charterers suffer losses due to delayed cargo delivery, they may claim compensation.

Charterers will focus on passage planning and its usual practice and previous audits.

Master must exercise care when granting "Charterers P&I" access to the vessel.

Verify any document handover with the office first.

Do not rely solely on “local P&I,” as they may act on Charterers’ behalf.

###### Loss of Hire (LoH) / Delay

The Master shall provide Charterers’ with off-hire statement, including bunker consumption, for the Owners to claim lost hire due to an H&M casualty.

##### P&I: Special Advice on Securing Evidence

###### Introduction

P&I covers Owners’ liability to 3rd parties, such as:

Crew illness and injury

Cargo damages and losses

Environmental damage claims

Note: Collisions and damages to Fixed and Floating Objects (FFO) are H&M subjects. Avoid involving P&I in these cases to prevent time loss.

###### Ship-Shore Cargo Quantity Discrepancy

In case of discrepancy in cargo quantity:

Verify all possible causes

Check voyage orders for specific instructions

Issue Letter of Protest (LOP) if the discrepancy remains

Inform Charterers as per voyage instructions

Tankers:

Recheck drafts, trim, cargo/ballast tank soundings, cargo temperatures, calculation of VEF

Recalculate cargo, considering tank calibrations and measurement methods

Mention any re-gauging/re-calculation in the vessel’s SOF

Dry Cargo Vessels:

Recheck drafts, ballast tank soundings, fuel, FW, and constants

Recalculate cargo using correct hydrostatic tables, hydrometers, and sounding tapes

Mention any re-reading/re-calculation in the vessel’s SOF

###### Cargo Contamination (Tankers)

Contamination can occur during loading, after loading, during passage, during tank cleaning, and during discharging.

Sources include shore tanks, previous cargo remnants, water, chlorides, inter-tank leakages, heating coil leakages, hydraulic oil leakages, and vapor contamination.

Upon noticing contamination:

Immediately inform operations department

Arrange for a P&I surveyor in consultation with the office

Seek office guidance and approval for subsequent actions

Take and seal sufficient samples, signed by the Chief Officer and Terminal representative

Maintain a proper activity log, keeping the office informed

###### Claims Following Damage or Loss of Cargo

Cargo claims by Receivers or Charterers are subject to Bills of Lading. Assess the cargo condition truly before release to avoid later liability. Arrange a P&I survey in coordination with the office.

For liquid bulk cargo, preserve:

- Spare set of samples taken and sealed by the P&I Surveyor

For dry cargo, preserve:

- Photographs illustrating damage dimensions

- SOF including:

- Date, time, and location of the incident

- Weather and visibility at the time

- Events leading to the incident

- Description of affected cargo

- Stowage place

- Lashings applied

- Involved gear or equipment

- Damaged vessel equipment

- Names and contact details of involved persons and witnesses

- Witness statements

###### Delays During Loading / Discharging

Prevent delays and claims:

- Keep the vessel ready to load/discharge upon cargo calculation completion.

For Tankers:

Comply with C/P unloading rate and manifold pressure

Maintain records of crude oil washing instructions

Issue an LOP if the Terminal cannot receive rates or pressure as per the C/P

Maintain a detailed pumping log and accurate port log records

Protest any delays

For Dry Cargo:

Maintain readiness for opening/closing hatch covers

###### Cargo ROB at Discharging Port

For Tankers:

Strip tanks of all cargo residues

Obtain a Dry Tank Certificate upon unloading completion

Ensure cargo remaining is within limits and actually unpumpable

Keep a cargo manifold connected and do not drain shore lines until the ROB certificate is signed

###### Off-Specification Cargo Claims (Tankers)

Claims may arise due to cargo quality issues, including contamination by impurities, residues, leakages, and improper tank cleaning or heating.

Prevent claims by:

- Complying with Charterer’s instructions and cleaning guidelines

- Following correct sampling procedures and maintain records

- Informing Charterer and Owner of claims due to off-spec cargo

- Arranging for a P&I surveyor and collect samples as per advice

- Issuing an LOP denying liability and note the same on any protest received

###### Demurrage Claims

Maintain documents supporting delays or restrictions imposed by the Terminal.

Ensure Terminal representative signs all documents and inform the office of delays due to shore Terminal failures.

###### Claims Following Environmental Pollution

For environmental damages, contact P&I and request a survey.

Quick action is essential to assess pollution extent, which will determine fines.

Preserve the following:

- Master’s SOF on pollution extent

- Witness SOF on pollution extent

- Photographs illustrating damage extent

###### Third-Party Injury

Claims for personal injury or loss of life usually result from carelessness. Ensure crew exercises high care in duties and provide 3rd parties with necessary PPE and warnings. Maintain and report subcontractor exposure hours using the KPI section in the SMM monthly report.

Consider the following individuals as subcontractors:

- Class surveyors

- Vetting inspectors

# 09. Mooring and Anchoring Operations

## 9.1 Mooring Equipment Management



### 9.1.1 Mooring Equipment - rev 0 issued 09.12.2024

##### Mooring Equipment

###### Introduction

Mooring equipment (wires, ropes, winches, brakes, tails, and shackles) and mooring fittings must be in good working condition. Ensure sufficient ropes and wires are available to safely moor in any weather or tide conditions that can be reasonably expected.

All vessels shall maintain an up-to-date inventory of mooring wires and ropes.

Following minimum spare equipment shall be maintained on bord:

- Tankers: Four spare mooring wires or ropes (as applicable) and four spare mooring tails.

- Dry Cargo Vessels: Two spare mooring ropes.

Each fitting must be marked by bead weld outline with its SWL, in addition to any markings required by other applicable standards.

The SWL should be expressed in tons (letter ‘T’) and should not be obscured during use.

The Line Management Plan and the Mooring System Management Plan provide vessel-specific information and guidelines about the vessel's mooring equipment and fittings.

###### Responsibilities

The Chief Engineer shall:

- Maintain the windlasses, mooring winches, brakes (including brake adjustment), and associated equipment.

- Inspect and assess the technical condition of the entire hydraulic system, including pumps, motor, and adjustment of brakes as per PMS.

The Chief Officer shall:

- Assist the Chief Engineer with the required maintenance for windlasses, mooring winches, brakes, and associated equipment as per PMS.

- Perform brake testing and update the test records.

- Visually inspect and assess the technical condition of all anchoring equipment before use.

The Responsible Officer at the mooring/anchor station shall: Visually inspect and assess the technical condition of all anchoring and mooring equipment before use.

###### Maintenance of Winch and Windlass Brake Linings

- Maintain winches and windlass equipment as per the PMS.

- Keep one spare set of brake linings and connecting screws and nuts on board for the windlass and one set for the mooring winches.

- Visually inspect brake linings and the brake control system regularly.

- Adjust the incremental adjusting device, as required, to ensure that the brake is fully applied well before the brake control mechanism reaches the end of its travel.

- Measure the brake lining thickness every three months and record measurements in the "Windlass – Winch Brake Lining Calibration" form.

Note: Brake lining thickness shall be measured with the brake tightened.

- Change the brake lining when the residual thickness reaches the lower limit set by the manufacturer.

- Use brake testing as a good opportunity to ensure the brake lining is in good condition.

- Carry out repairs/replacement of required parts if the test fails.

- Maintain records of windlass/winch brake lining calibrations and replacements in the PMS.

###### Winch Brake Test

Winch brakes shall be tested:

- At least yearly.

- After each brake lining replacement or winch repairs

- If brake malfunctions are detected.

- In cases of early brake slippage or associated malfunctions/mooring incidents.

The scope of the test is to:

- Verify the BHC (Brake Holding Capacity) that should hold 80% of SDMBL (Ship’s Designed MBL).

- Adjust the BRC (Brake Rendering Capacity) at 60% of SDMBL.

- Mark the BRC limit on the brake’s tightening spindle (or where suitable for easy recognition).

- Mark the torque value required to tighten the brake up to the BRC mark.

- Ensure the crew is aware of the limit to which the brakes should be tightened.

When testing, apply a hydraulic force to the winch drum equivalent to 60% of the SDMBL on the first layer of the rope (for split drum winches) and ensure that the winch brake slips (or renders) at that point.

Then, mark the tightened brake screw at the point it slips. This test is not to determine how strong the winch brake is but to ensure the brake renders at 60% of the SDMBL.

Applying more force causes slippage of the brake to ensure the winch brake remains the weakest point of the mooring system.

Common Mistakes:

- Using Line MBL instead of SDMBL as the reference when calculating the required hydraulic jack pressure.

- Considering the test successful if the brake holds after reaching the calculated hydraulic jack pressure. It must be clearly seen that the brake slips after exceeding the calculated BRC limit.

Issue a Mooring Winch Brake Test Certificate as per form TANK 57G.

Ships provided with a hydraulic winch brake test kit shall:

- Calibrate the pressure gauge before the test, using the reference pressure gauge.

- Maintain records of this calibration.

The pressure reference gauge shall be:

- Calibrated ashore yearly.

- Provided with a Calibration Certificate.

Safety Considerations during Winch Brake Test

Mounting the Hydraulic Lifting Device

Attention should be given to the following:

- Clean hydraulic couplings before connecting.

- Do not kink hydraulic hoses and protect them against mechanical damage.

- Do not exceed the rated loads of the hydraulic components.

- Perform maintenance of hydraulic components only when they are depressurized.

- Clean hydraulic components after use and protect them against environmental influences.

Mounting the Brake Test Kit

- Ensure the mooring rope is properly wound around the drum.

- Ensure no pulling force is exerted on the rope.

- During the brake test, significant forces are applied to the bore holes in the drum and the bolts in the bracket. Therefore:

- Avoid using regular screws to secure the bracket to the drum.

- Only use the provided high-strength bolts for this purpose.

Risk of Injury: Use appropriate PPE. Follow the maker’s instructions and the procedure below for the test.

Risk of Equipment Instability:

- Test components mounted in an unstable position can slip and tilt under load.

- Ensure the surface beneath the hydraulic cylinder and the counter piece is stable, level, and clean.

- The hydraulic cylinder should be positioned vertically and aligned straight with the bracket/cap mounted to the drum.

- The head of the jack piston should fit centrally into the designated milled recess/crevice/cap of the bracket (depending on test kit design).

Risk of Crushing: There is a potential risk of crushing between the bracket and the hydraulic cylinder. Secure the mooring winch drum to prevent rotation using the spindle band brake.

Mooring Winch Brake Test – Procedure

The Chief Officer shall follow this procedure:

- Review the instruction manual and documentation for the mooring winches and BRC test procedure.

- Confirm the availability of all parts of the "Brake Test Kit" provided by the manufacturer.

- Ensure coordination requirements are established with the engine department for this specific task.

- Conduct a Risk Assessment, considering potential hazards such as injury, equipment stability, crushing, slippery surfaces, lifting heavy objects, inadequate supervision / coordination / communication, and weather conditions.

- Hold a toolbox meeting, referencing relevant drawings and equipment manuals specific to the job. Provide training to all crew involved in mooring/unmooring operations regarding winch brake tightening limits.

Mounting the Brake Test Kit

- Securely fasten the bracket (link plate) to the drum using the original high-strength bolts and nuts.

Note: Bracket or link design may vary (L-shaped or triangular) and may be secured by 2 or 3 bolts.

- Place the hydraulic cylinder underneath the bracket.

Note: Ensure that the head of the hydraulic jack piston is centrally located below the lower edge of the test bracket or link plate, allowing it to engage into the milled recess/crevice/cap of the bracket when the cylinder expands.

- Manually adjust (rotate) the mooring drum to align the bracket (test link plate) with the hydraulic jack, maintaining a clearance of approximately 10mm.

Caution: Do not use winch hydraulic force to align the bracket/link with the hydraulic jack piston. Disengage the drum and rotate it by hand to the desired position for alignment. Then tighten the winch brake. Final precise alignment can be done by lifting the hydraulic jack piston.

Brake Testing

- Calculate the hydraulic force to be applied by the hydraulic jack on the winch drum equivalent to 60% of the SDMBL, using form TANK 57 G.

- Identify the theoretical torque required to be applied on the hand brake corresponding to 60% winch MBL (this sometimes can be found in ship’s drawings)

Note: if this information is not available in the ship’s drawings identify it by trial and error using a torque wrench when tightening up the brake.

- Tighten the brake using a torque wrench up to the theoretical torque value

- Begin jacking up by slowly pressurizing the hydraulic hand pump, maintaining a safe distance from the jack.

- Operate the jack lever until the desired pressure (as specified in form TANK 57 G) is achieved on the pressure gauge of the hand pump.

If the winch drum slips/renders and the bracket lifts before the required pressure is reached, the test needs to be repeated with further tightening of the brake.

- Gradually decrease the pressure, monitoring the pressure drop on the gauge, until the hydraulic cylinder is fully retracted and the gauge reads "0".

- Repeat the test until the brake slips at the specified pressure and record the actual torque used to tighten the brake.

Note: If the spindle of the band brake cannot be turned enough, the brake lining must be replaced.

If the winch drum does not slip/render:

- Gradually increase the pressure using the hand pump. The brake should start to slip, causing the bracket to lift.

- If the brake does not slip, it means the actual holding load exceeds the required holding load.

- Slowly reduce the pressure below the required level while monitoring the pressure drop on the gauge.

- Slightly release the spindle band brake and repeat the test.

- Repeat step 12 until the exact Brake Rendering Capacity (BRC) is achieved, corresponding to the calculated force of the hydraulic jack.

Note: Ensure that the BRC and the test date are correctly marked and recorded in appropriate locations on the mooring winch.

- Once completed, carefully observe the pressure drop on the gauge until the hydraulic cylinder is fully retracted, and the gauge reads "0".

- Remove the brake test kit and store it in a suitable location.

- Mark the exact rendering point on the brake spindle with the appropriate indication for the BRC.

- Make the necessary entries in the deck logbook and complete form Tank 57 G, documenting the results of the Mooring Winch Brake Test.

- Mark the value of the actual torque that has to be applied on the handbrake corresponding to the BRC mark.

Promote safe and efficient procedures during mooring or unmooring. Master and safety officer are responsible to check all heaving lines on board.

Note:	Make sure that monkey fists are without any weights and in compliance with the company requirements

Be aware that high modulus synthetic fiber ropes have similar breaking characteristics to wire ropes.

###### Mooring Teams and interaction with Third Party Mooring Gangs

Master is overall in charge of the mooring operations.

Assign typical teams and responsibilities for mooring operations as follows:

For normal mooring operations at berth, STS, or at FPSO moored side-by-side

When mooring at Multibuoys Chief officer and 2nd Officer shall switch team and responsibilities (i.e. Chief officer will be the leader of the Forward mooring Team and vice versa)

For mooring operations at SBM, SPM or FPSO in tandem

*) if necessary

*) if necessary

Note:	Master can add crewmembers to above teams if available and if he deems necessary.

When using third party mooring teams, Master shall make sure that:

- The mooring hazards are reassessed in conjunction with the mooring party’s Team Leader

- The operation is discussed and carefully planned

- Chief Officer is supervising the mooring operation and ensures that safety standards comply with Company’s requirements (PPE, Communication equipment, etc.)

- Bosun and one O/S assist the Mooring Team with the operation of the mooring equipment whenever/if required under the guidance of the Team Leader

- The Chief Officer shall have overriding authority to stop the operation and restore safety standards

###### Mooring Planning Guidance

The officer-in-charge at the mooring station must adhere to the following safe operating guidelines:

Discussion and Briefing

- Discuss the plan with the pilot.

- Brief personnel on the mooring plan, including:

- Applicable mooring pattern

- Use of tugs and mooring handling boats

- Local conditions that may lead to dangerous occurrences

Risk Assessment

- Prepare a risk assessment including mitigating measures considering:

- Sudden failures of mooring lines

- Whiplash or snap-back effects

- Precautions when working with drum ends, stoppers, and tug lines

Toolbox Meeting (carried out by Team Leaders)

- Discuss mooring procedures and hazards of snap-back zones with all team

Note: The configuration of unsafe areas can change with the mooring pattern. Therefore, it is not recommended to mark these zones on decks as it may give a false sense of security. The Code of Safe Working Practices recommends considering the whole mooring deck as a danger zone.

Preventative Measures (Team Leader):

- Check the condition of stoppers for:

- Damage

- Correct size

- Made of the same material as the mooring rope

- Condition of securing points and shackles

Note: Refer to OCIMF “Effective Mooring” guide for proper use of different types of stoppers.

- Ensure visibility between the winch operator and the crew.

- Avoid helping those handling mooring lines;

- Keep the team clear of ropes, wires, and tug lines when under heavy load.

Note: Plan the activity before approaching the line. Use a minimum number of personnel near the line and vacate the danger zone as soon as possible.

Crew Safety (Team Leader)

Ensure crew do not:

- Stand in potentially unsafe areas or in the bight of any rope.

- Stop runaway lines with their feet.

- Lead a wire rope across a fiber rope on the same bollard.

- Use a wire rope on the drum end of a winch as a check wire.

- Cross mooring lines under tension.

- Stand or pass near a line while it is being tensioned or while the ship is being moved along the pier.

Safe Practices (all crew)

- Wear proper protective gear, including safety shoes, helmets, and leather gloves.

Note: Avoid gloves becoming caught in the turns of the rope when operating drum ends.

- Use a thimble when joining a wire rope to a natural or synthetic fiber rope.

- Ensure both the wire and the fiber rope have the same direction of lay.

- Avoid using a wire rope directly from a reel unless designed for that purpose.

- Control wire rope payout by turns around bitts or drum ends.

- Avoid using damaged synthetic ropes.

Caution: Ensure the seaman throwing the heaving line is aware of the monkey fist trajectory to avoid injury. Monkey fists shall not be weighted.

Using Tugs (Team Leader)

- Be cautious when using tugs; the condition of tug lines is unknown to the ship’s crew.

- Ensure tugs are pushing in designated positions; report deviations to the bridge.

- Supervise when tug lines are made fast or let go.

- Confirm that the tug does not start to tow or heave in its line before it is secured or released from the bollard.

- Stand clear of the towline and out of the snap-back zone.

Note: If line handling is involved, ensure enough personnel are present for safe and expedient operations.

Rope Care (all crew)

- Avoid rope contact with chemicals or paint and prolonged exposure to sunlight.

- Coil ropes on wooden pallets or gratings to allow free drainage and airflow.

- Reel the line on the winch drum to pull against the fixed end of the brake strap.

Note: This ensures the brake tightens as the load increases.

- Tighten winch brakes to the specified limit /marking.

- When making fast on vertical bollards, pass two full turns on the leading post before the figure-of-eight turns for safer handling during release.

General Precautions (all crew)

- Snap-back from high-modulus synthetic ropes will generally be along the length of the line and not in a snaking manner.

- Consider the entire mooring deck as a snap-back zone.

- If in doubt about potential danger zones from snap-back, keep personnel away from any line under tension.

- Treat synthetic lines under load with caution.

Mooring Stations Preparation Procedure

The designated officer shall be in-charge of safe operations at the mooring station.

An officer must be present on the mooring deck during berthing or un-berthing operations.

Discussion and Testing

Discuss the mooring plan with the master.

Switch on and test the following:

- Communications between the bridge and mooring decks.

- Power supply to the winches well in advance to warm up the system, depending on the environmental conditions.

Caution: Avoid prolonged idle operation of the power packs to prevent overheating.

- Cooling water supply for winches, if applicable.

- Free rotation of winch drum in both directions.

- Easy and smooth operation of the drum clutch.

- Visual examination for any irregularities, oil leaks, etc.

Briefing/toolbox talk

Brief persons involved in mooring operations regarding:

- Applicable mooring pattern.

- Use of tugs and mooring handling boats.

- Local conditions that may lead to dangerous occurrences.

Experienced Personnel

- Keep an experienced seaman on the winch control.

- Make sure the clutch securing pins are in position.

- Avoid accidental release of the clutch while operating winches and windlasses.

Anchor Preparation

- Clear the lashings on both anchors.

Note: Keep the anchors ready for dropping in an emergency. At some berths, the anchors will require to be secured due to the presence of pipelines.

Completed

##### Mooring operation

###### Responsibility

The master shall decide on a safe mooring arrangement at a berth or buoy, considering:

- Weather

- Current

- Tides

- Type of ship

- Exposure of the berth

The master should discuss his intentions with the pilot.

Master and the pilot are responsible for all contacts and arrangements with the tug masters or the line handling boat personnel.

The master and the chief engineer must agree on the operating parameters of the main engine and bow thruster (if fitted), such as:

- Starting and stopping procedures.

- Notice period required.

- Emergency full ahead and full astern procedures.

- Number of consecutive starts.

###### Mooring Guidance – Bridge

The master and OOW shall follow the guidelines.

Approach the Berth

Approach the berth carefully, at a safe speed.

Allow sufficient safety margin for:

- Unexpected engine failure.

- Inclement weather.

- Other factors.

Apply power for the main engine and bow thruster with care.

Caution: Do not make violent use of the main engines or thruster.

Note: Operate the bow thruster carefully when the vessel is in light condition.

Discuss with Deck Officers

- Mooring arrangement.

- Tug arrangement.

- Use hand steering mode.

###### Mooring Guidance – Deck

The designated officer shall discuss the mooring and tug arrangement with the master and mooring team.

Handle and store ropes, wires, and mooring equipment carefully. Avoid the common causes of parting mooring ropes, such as:

- Using worn mooring lines

- Over-tightening of the brakes

- Sudden movements of the ship

Exercise care in the vicinity of the operating power supplies of the mooring equipment.

Check the integrity of insulation of the electric cables visually prior to any operation.

Ensure there is enough power supply.

Note: Maintain a spare motor or necessary spares for repairs in case of hydraulic motor failures (consult with manufacturer’s instructions).

###### Mooring Operation – Deck

The designated officer(s) shall follow these guidelines:

Carry out mooring operations safely.

Keep the propeller and bow thruster clear. Inform the bridge if they are not clear.

Use mooring lines of the same size and type (material) for all leads.

Arrange mooring lines so that lines in the same service are about the same length between the ship and the shore bollard.

When turning up a rope on bitts, take two full turns around the leading post before belaying in a figure of eight fashion. (MEG 7.3.2)

Note: This reduces the tendency to pull the two posts together.

Disconnect mooring drums from the winch drive whenever the mooring line is tensioned, and the band brake is fully applied.

Note: If the brakes render, hydraulic or electric drives can suffer severe damage.

Caution: Do not secure mooring lines to winch warping drums.

Use only a single layer of line on the tension section of the drum.

Note: Operation with additional layers decreases the brake holding capacity (MEG4 6.3.4.1).

Connect tails to a wire mooring line using correct shackles like those manufactured by Mandal, Tonsberg, or Boss.

Connect tails to HMPE ropes using a cow hitch.

Note: Tonsberg shackles have a straight pin, and the tail should be connected to it. Mandal shackles have a curved roller, and the wire should be connected to it. Boss links can be connected in either direction. Rig the connecting links as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Check that the SWL of the joining shackle is equal to or greater than the SWL of the mooring line to which it is attached.

Protect the eye of the tails with a suitable sheath.

Caution: Do not use leather sheathing.

Stop or close the deck machinery cooling system (water or ventilation) upon completing mooring or unmooring.

Attach rat guards to mooring lines once alongside.

Keep the anchor chain stopper or guillotine bar open at port for emergency use if required by local regulations.

##### Use of Tugs & Line Handling Boats Guidance

Pre-plan the procedure when the vessel uses tugboats or line-handling boats.

The master and the pilot are responsible for coordination with the tug masters or the line-handling boat personnel.

Following below guidance when the vessel will employ tugs to enter or leave port:

When ordering tugs, consider:

Weather conditions

Wave height

Navigational constraints (e.g., locks, docks, etc.)

The vessel’s maneuvering characteristics

Established practices of the ports concerned

Consult the pilot regarding the number of tugs to be used, particularly if unfamiliar with the port.

Note: Sometimes a pilot's advice regarding tug requirements may be influenced by other than professional considerations.

Decide the number and required horsepower of tugs considering:

Operating limitations of available tugs

Prevailing navigational circumstances

Local port requirements regulating:

Requirement for use

Number of tugs

Capacity of tugs

Caution: Ensure that tugs do not use bollard pull power greater than the ship’s mooring equipment SWL, as it might damage the ship’s mooring equipment and put personnel at risk.

Inform the pilot / tug master of the maximum permitted bollard pull capacity of the vessel.

Communicate early with the Tug Masters to discuss:

- Position of rendezvous

- Speed of transit when connected to tugs

- Projected ETA

- Whether using the vessel’s towing lines or the tug’s lines

- The positioning of the tugs

- The anticipated interaction between vessel and tugs

- The vessel’s mooring characteristics

- The tug push points on the ship’s hull

Early assess the rendezvous area to ensure it is clear of obstructions and traffic density.

Continue essential watch-keeping duties, including a good lookout, when tugs are approaching and getting secured.

Prepare deck stations before tugs approach:

Have crew at deck stations

Flake out heaving lines and towing lines to pass to tugs

Exercise care when picking up and lowering the towing line(s).

Inspect the lines once connected and report the condition to the bridge.

Keep the vessel in manual steering and at maneuvering speed.

On arrival, do not make any commitment or sign receipts regarding the number of tugs to be used when departing.

If the tug company has difficulty with this, request them to leave a blank receipt for the master to complete on departure.

Hand over this receipt to the agent or pilot for delivery to the tug company.

If required to inform the tug company in advance of the number of tugs required for departure, inform them through the agent, having due regard to the local conditions.

Enter the times of tugs making fast and letting go on the receipts.

When required to hand the receipt to the agent before departure, send the timings via message to the agent for entry on the signed receipt before giving it to the tug company.

When employing line-handling boats in port operations, establish proper communication links between the bridge team and the boat personnel.

Observe the following points:

Known operational limitations of the boats

Sea state interference caused by the vessel that might affect the movement of the boat(s)

Proper use of messengers, heaving lines/monkey fists, etc.

Proper connection of lines

Regular inspection of lines to prevent:

Over-tightening

Free oscillations

##### Safety Precautions at Berth

###### Guidance for ship to shore access arrangements

## 9.3 STS, SPM and Specific Mooring Operations



### 9.3.1 STS, SPM and Specific Mooring Operations - rev 0 issued 09.12.2024

##### STS Operations Mooring

###### Responsibility

The master is in charge and shall decide on proceeding with the STS maneuver, considering:

The weather

Current

The size of the ship

Mooring arrangement and equipment

Type, number, and size of fenders, in conjunction with Office and STS Provider

Caution: STS mooring/unmooring during dark hours shall be avoided.

If/when requested to carry out nighttime operations, the Master shall:

- Carry out a risk assessment for nighttime mooring/unmooring, considering:

- location of STS,

- weather conditions and forecast,

- whether the operation is planned underway or at anchor

- STS equipment

- STS experience of own vessel personnel

- STS experience of the POAC

- STS experience of other vessel’s personnel,

- Availability of tug assistance

- Submit the Risk Assessment to Operations Department

- Obtain further advice from the Company.

Note: Based on the RA the Office may agree with nighttime operations, but Master will always have the overriding authority.

###### Planning

The master shall discuss the manoeuvre and mooring plan with the mooring master.

They are responsible for all contacts and arrangements with the other vessel or the line handling boat personnel.

The master, mooring master, and the chief engineer must agree on the operating parameters of the main engine and bow thruster (if fitted), such as:

Starting and stopping procedures

Maximum continuous speed requirements and limitations

Abort maneuver

Emergency full ahead and full astern procedures, etc.

Refer to the latest edition of the Ship to Ship Transfer Guide and to the vessel’s STS Manual for detailed operational and safety guidance.

Comply with relevant STS checklists TANK 11 and TANK 11A (when STS in port) during all stages of cargo transfer operation. Where vapor balancing during STS operation will take place, ensure compliance with STS checklist TANK 11B.

STS checklists should be retained onboard along with other STS-related records applicable to the type of STS operation. This includes:

The JPO (Joint Plan of Operations) as provided by the service provider

Risk assessment as submitted by the Service Provider

Ship’s Risk assessment

Detailed Mooring Plan of participating vessels

Copies of certificates of fenders and hoses used

Notification to coastal authorities (if required)

Details of drills associated with the specific STS Operation

Records of crew experience

Post-operation feedback/assessment by the master

Prior to commencement of any STS operation, a Joint Plan of Operation (JPO) should be developed to ensure that all parties involved, including the STS service provider, are in alignment with regard to how the operation is to be conducted.

In all cases, the person in overall advisory control (POAC), STS Superintendent, or transfer organizer should establish agreement and consensus between all parties.

The JPO should include a compilation of information from various sources. Refer to the latest edition of the Ship to Ship Transfer Guide and to the vessel’s STS Manual.

The master should ensure that the JPO is developed, available on board, and reviewed by all ship’s staff participating in the STS transfer operation. The JPO should be retained on board as part of STS-related documentation.

###### Mooring STS Operations Guidance – Bridge

The master and OOW shall follow these guidelines:

- Conduct a risk assessment for the mooring operation.

- Conduct a toolbox talk with the bridge team and officers in charge of mooring gangs; include the mooring master.

- Ensure all navigation and communications equipment is in working order.

- A proficient helmsman mans the wheel.

- Comply with STS Check Lists TANK 11 or TANK 11A, as applicable.

- Test communications bridge to bridge and bridge to mooring gangs before approach.

- Establish a back-up method of communication.

- Control engine movement and steering remotely from the bridge.

- Approach the STS position carefully, under the directions of the mooring master. Allow sufficient safety margin for:

Unexpected engine failure

Inclement weather

Other factors

- Apply power for the main engine and bow thruster in a positive but easy manner.

Caution: Do not make violent use of main engines or thruster.

Note: Operate the bow thruster carefully when the vessel is in a light condition.

- Ascertain the number of available air starts.

- Illuminate the deck adequately at night and, if possible, the ship's side and fenders.

####### When Mooring is Carried Out Underway

- Abort the operation if any of the masters or the mooring master has doubts about the safety.

- When maneuvering commences, broadcast all necessary safety information.

- During maneuvering, the maneuvering characteristics of the involved ships, together with local conditions and/or knowledge, will indicate an optimum approach. Common approaches include:

      - Keeping the wind and sea on the port bow of the constant heading ship.

      - Keeping the wind and swell on the port or starboard quarter of the constant heading ship to reduce loads on the fender rigging and the relative wind across the deck.

- The maneuvering ship should approach with a small angle of approach.

- The RPM of the main engine(s) of the constant heading ship are adjusted to provide a speed through the water as requested by the mooring master or master of the maneuvering ship.

Caution: Do not make changes without advising the mooring master or master of the maneuvering ship.

- Anticipate the effects of ship interaction when maneuvering at close quarters:

      - The maneuvering ship should use optimum helm response to counter the effects of interaction and maintain effective heading control, keeping her engines turning ahead.

      - Ships must maneuver at speeds of 5 knots or less.

      - If the maneuvering ship has a higher minimum speed, the mooring master may consider increasing the speed of the constant heading ship to enable the maneuvering ship to complete the berthing operation without temporarily stopping her engine to reduce speed through the water.

      - In doing so, consider that the effects of interaction between ships increase as the square of the ship's speed through the water, and any limitations posed by loads on fender rigging.

On completion of mooring, the constant heading ship will power all future maneuvers and, if a transfer at anchor is planned, will proceed to the agreed anchoring position:

- Avoid excessive use of the engine, especially astern movement, when anchoring.

- During this time, the former maneuvering vessel must maintain rudder amidships and engines stopped.

- Use the anchor on the opposite side to which the ship is moored.

- At anchor, each ship is responsible for watchkeeping arrangements.

Caution! When the STS Operation is carried out at anchor, if the environmental conditions are changing causing adverse effects (e.g. unsynchronized rolling of STS vessels), the Master shall re-evaluate the Risk Assessment and consider proceeding with STS the operation underway to avoid mooring lines damages and contact between vessels.

####### When Mooring with One Ship at Anchor

- Conduct a risk assessment with the mooring master to evaluate the necessity of tug assistance for the maneuver.

Note: Where the current and wind are not from the same direction, or the wind varies in speed or direction, the anchored ship can yaw (or lie cross-current), making it difficult for the maneuvering ship to berth alongside.

- Decide on the scope of the cable considering:

Water depth

Holding ground

Winds

Currents

Underkeel clearance

Allowance for the fact that the single anchor will be required to hold both ships

- Allow for the anchored vessel to be brought up to her anchor.

- Ensure that the anchored vessel is lying on a steady heading with reference to prevailing current and wind conditions.

Caution: Do not berth when the tidal stream is due to change.

- Broadcast all necessary safety messages.

- The maneuvering vessel must moor on the opposite side from the anchor used.

- The anchored ship must continuously advise her heading to the maneuvering ship and warn if she has the tendency to yaw.

- Excessive deck lighting must not hinder the approach of the maneuvering vessel.

Caution! When the STS Operation is carried out at anchor, if the environmental conditions are changing causing adverse effects (e.g. unsynchronized rolling of STS vessels), the Master shall re-evaluate the Risk Assessment and consider proceeding with STS operation underway to avoid mooring lines damages and contact between vessels.

##### Reverse (STS) Lightering Operations (Topping-Off)

Reverse STS is a ship-to-ship transfer operation in which a laden tanker, typically of Suezmax or Aframax size, is maneuvered alongside a partially laden very large crude carrier (VLCC) or ultra-large crude carrier (ULCC) to transfer cargo to the larger vessel.

Both vessels are laden or partially laden in this operation, making it more challenging than conventional STS.

The manoeuvring vessel shall carry the primary fenders. When selecting the fenders, consider:

- Potential for increased berthing velocities

- Higher angles of approach compared to conventional STS operations

Note: Use the formulae and guidance in OCIMF Ship to Ship Transfer Guide, Appendix H, to select suitable fenders.

Control the approach speed to avoid damage to fenders. Employ tugs if necessary. Additionally:

- Carry out a risk assessment.

- Calculate berthing energy to determine the required fender absorption capability.

- Consider the effect of approach velocities on the berthing energy absorption characteristics of the fender system.

- Consider the influence of the weather, sea, and swell on the maneuver capability of the loaded vessel.

- Employ the services of an STS provider that provides all necessary STS equipment and service vessels.

###### Mooring for Reverse Lightering Operation Guidance – Deck

The designated officer(s) shall follow these guidelines:

- Discuss the risk assessment for mooring and anchoring operations with the master.

- Conduct a toolbox talk with all mooring gang and anchor party.

- Ensure all crew wear appropriate PPE.

- Raise awareness of the mooring gang regarding the dangers of mooring rope snap back.

- Handle and store ropes, wires, and mooring equipment carefully.

- Exercise care in the vicinity of the operating power supplies of the mooring equipment.

- Make sure there is enough power supply for the mooring winches.

- Follow the master’s orders.

- Carry out mooring operations safely.

- Keep the mooring area as clear as possible.

- Keep the propeller and bow thruster clear.

- Inform the bridge if they are not clear.

- Use mooring lines of the same size and type (material) for all leads.

- Disconnect mooring drums from the winch drive whenever the mooring line is tensioned, and the band brake is fully applied.

- Use only a single layer of line on the tension section of the drum.

- Do not tighten the ropes excessively, allowing for dynamic forces resulting from environmental conditions.

##### Mooring to Single Point Moorings (SPM) / FPSO

###### Single Point Mooring

Description:

A floating buoy anchored offshore

Handles liquid cargo such as petroleum products for tanker ships

Serves as a link between shore facilities and tankers

Used for loading or off-loading liquid and gas cargo

Benefits:

Ability to handle extra-large vessels

Saves fuel and time by avoiding port entry

Accommodates ships with high drafts easily

Handles large quantities of cargo efficiently

Mooring Arrangement:

The buoy moves freely within defined limits considering wind, waves, current, and tanker ship conditions

Anchored to the seabed using anchor chains (legs) attached to anchor points on the seabed

The floating buoy has a rotating part that connects to the tanker

The tanker moors to the buoy using a hawser arrangement shackled to an integrated hook on the buoy deck

Chafe chains are connected at the tanker end of the hawser to prevent damage from the tanker fairlead

###### Preparations for mooring

The master shall ensure the following:

- Adequate personnel for mooring to SPM/FPSO, supervised by certified officers

- Risk assessment carried out, available, and discussed with all team leaders, including Pilot/Mooring master

- Toolbox meeting conducted with deck crew prior to operations

- Two-way communication established between stations and the bridge, with alternative means ready if available

- Visual contact and proper communication established between the officer in charge and the winch operator at the mooring station

- Fill out:

Pilot card

Master/pilot information exchange form from DNV navigator software

- Switch on and test the following:

Communication between the forecastle and bridge

Power supply to the forecastle

Mooring equipment on forecastle

Caution: Start hydraulic power packs well in advance in cold weather to warm up the system, avoiding prolonged idle operation to prevent overheating.

Cooling water supply to the forecastle equipment, if applicable

- Connect towing hawser on poop deck to tug.

- Approach the buoy stemming against the current/weather.

- Prepare hawsers to hoist the buoy pick-up line on the winch storage drums.

Caution: Do not use winch drum ends (warping ends) to handle pick-up ropes of the chafing chain (MEG4 4.3.3).

- Keep the vessel’s speed less than 0.2 knots when within 150-200 meters from the buoy.

- At about 120 meters from the buoy, connect the messenger to the hawser.

Note: The vessel should make the final approach with the buoy on the bow, rather than dead ahead, to permit continuous observation by the Pilot and Master.

- Bring the vessel to a dead stop when 45-60 meters from the buoy/FPSO.

- Use the engines several times to retain headway.

- Assist with mooring winches to haul in the vessel.

Note:

Use “mooring” mode for higher speed (if available).

Switch to “windlass” mode for greater pulling power before the chafing chain reaches the chock (if available).

Keep a minimum number of pick-up hawser layers on the split drum to avoid power loss.

- Secure using the chain stopper.

Caution: Do not load the pick-up rope as this affects vessel manoeuvrability and may lead to rope failure.

Completed

Unmoor from SPM or FPSO Procedure

The master and designated officer shall follow this procedure.

Carry out risk assessment and discuss it with all personnel involved, including the Pilot/Mooring master. Conduct a toolbox meeting with the deck crew before operations.

- Fill out form NAV 06 - Bridge And Deck Preparation For Departure.

- Fill out:

Pilot card

Master/pilot information exchange form from DNV navigator software

- Use the engines ahead to reduce weight on the chains.

- Release the chain from the bow stopper.

- Use engines slowly astern to clear the buoy.

- Lower hawser and pick-up rope into the water in a controlled manner.

Note: Keep almost vertical without tension.

- Use engines to keep clear of:

Pick-up rope

SPM

- Steer the vessel clear of the buoy once clear of the pick-up rope.

- Release the aft tug in a controlled manner.

Caution: Maintain communication with the bridge to avoid fouling the propeller when releasing the tug line.

Completed

##### Tandem Mooring

This method of loading from an FPSO or FSU involves the tanker maintaining position astern of the FPSO/FSU on approximately the same heading relative to the weather.

The close proximity between the offloading tanker and the FPSO during the offloading is a significant safety concern.

The mooring of the tanker will require the assistance of one large-sized dedicated tug and one part-time medium-sized tug.

###### Guidance for Safe Operations- Tandem Mooring

This section provides information on the practical aspects of FPSO/FSU and tanker hardware and operations.

####### Weather Limitations

Approach within 3 nm of the FPSO, provided the maximum wind speed, Hs, Hmax, visibility, and FPSO/FSU motions and yaw rate are within safe limits. Both the terminal and the tanker master have the authority to cease or suspend operations at any time for safety reasons.

####### Communications

Establish two different systems providing clear and uninterrupted voice communications (e.g., VHF and UHF). Consider any loss of communication as potentially serious.

####### Approach Speed

The speed of the tanker’s approach to the FPSO/FSU is typically as follows:

3 nautical miles from the FPSO/FSU: < 5 knots

1 nautical mile from the FPSO/FSU: < 2 knots

1000 meters from the FPSO/FSU: < 0.5 knot

The speed of approach from 500 m to the line shooting position should not exceed 0.5 knots.

####### Station Keeping

The tanker should maintain position within the limits defined by the terminal operating limits diagram.

The tanker should inform the FPSO/FSU of any condition on board that may reduce its station-keeping capability.

The shuttle tanker master or duty officer has a duty to stop the operation if station keeping deteriorates.

The tanker should continue offtake only if the wind speed, Hs, visibility, and FPSO/FSU motions are within safe limits, as per the FSOG.

Note: Typical values for tankers are measured 10 min mean wind < 45 knots, Hs < 4.0 m, Visibility > 100 m, FPSO/FSU/tanker roll, and pitch not leading to snatch loads on the hawser.

##### Mooring at Multi Buoy Mooring (MBM) & Conventional Buoy Mooring (CBM) systems & Midstream Buoys

An MBM/CBM/Midstream Buoy system usually consists of three or more permanently anchored buoys.

They are used for smaller tankers in moderate or directional environmental conditions and where the frequency of loading/offloading operations is limited.

###### Guidance for Mooring at MBM/CBM

- Conduct a risk assessment for mooring at MBM/CBM.

- Discuss the mooring plan with all mooring team leaders.

- Conduct a toolbox talk with all mooring team members.

- Complete form NAV 07 - Bridge and Deck Preparation for Arrival.

- Prepare mooring winches, windlasses, and anchors.

- Embark the MBM/CBM mooring master.

- Fill out the pilot card and Master/pilot information exchange form from DNV navigator software.

- Test communications between the bridge, deck, terminal, and engine room.

- Test the power supply to the mooring and anchoring system and navigational equipment.

- Connect towing hawsers to tugs.

- Get directions from the mooring master to maneuver the vessel and let go of anchors.

Note: For optimum holding effect, the angle between anchor cables should be 60º - 90º.

- Send the mooring lines to mooring boats for connection to the buoys system.

Note: Maintain good communication (visual, radio, etc.) with the boats to coordinate pay-out and heave the mooring line when secured.

- The order in which lines are laid out to the buoys depends on the environmental conditions, to counteract the effects of the prevailing winds and current (e.g., lines on the windward side are put out first).

- If the tanker leaves the berth, the mooring procedure is reversed.

Caution: Do not use engines when stern lines are in the water.

If the lines are cleared, retrieve the anchors.

##### Double Banking

###### Introduction

Double banking on tankers occurs when two or more tankers are berthed at the same jetty, constraining each other's presence or operations.

Double banking is sometimes used for conducting multiple transfers between the shore and more than one tanker at the same jetty simultaneously.

The outermost tanker may be moored to an inner tanker or to the shore, with hose strings led from the shore, across the inner tanker, to the outermost.

Seek approval from the office when double banking operations are planned.

Caution: Do not conduct double banking of tankers on a berth for cargo operations unless a formal engineering study and risk assessment have been carried out.

##### Double Banking on Dry Cargo Vessels

It is not common, but a bulk carrier may be ordered by her charterers to double bank and conduct cargo operations from/to a cargo barge.

Note: Review the content of the charter party in anticipation of and prior to conducting double banking operations if an STS clause is included.

###### Double-Banking Guidance

The master and officers shall follow these guidelines:

- Prepare a formal procedure and safety plan.

- Ensure that all parties involved consider and agree to the following:

- Safe arrival and departure procedure

- Strength of jetty construction

- Mooring fittings

- Mooring arrangements

- Personnel access

- Management of operational safety

- Personnel availability to comply with rest hour requirements

- Only one operation to be undertaken during critical stages of any single operation

- Liability

- Contingency planning

- Firefighting

- Emergency unberthing

##### Mooring to Automated Vacuum System Guidance - Dry Vessels

Terminals must confirm the following prior to arrival:

###### Hull Suitability

Vessel hull must be free from all barnacles, marine growth, rust scale, flaking paint, and salt build-up.

Scuppers, tug push points, and deck drains should not have a protruding lip surface.

Welds and hull patch repairs must be no greater than 10mm in depth.

Hull dents or deformations must be no greater than 20mm in depth and are not to exceed 1m of hull length.

###### Mooring

The master and designated officer shall follow additional procedures to standard mooring operations and use of Tugs & Line Handling Boats Guidance:

Discuss with the pilot the approach and mooring plan.

Discuss and agree with the Pilot/Terminal to pass mooring lines as a backup system in case of vacuum system failure (usually known as COMFORT Lines).

Note: All backup lines (COMFORT Lines) will be attached to a winch drum (i.e., not to bits or winch ends).

Discuss the vacuum system mooring plan with all mooring team leaders.

Conduct a toolbox talk with all mooring team members.

###### Requirements When Alongside

Maximum vessel Bow/Stern trim: +/- 5 meters.

Maximum vessel Port/Starboard list no greater than 2 degrees.

De-ballasting must be undertaken using the seaside outlet discharge side for the duration of loading. In special circumstances agreed prior to berthing, the same side alongside de-ballasting may be approved on the condition that outlets are below the water line at the time of discharge.

Hatch covers are not to protrude beyond the vessel handrails at any time.

Razor wire or other similar piracy boarding prevention devices must be removed prior to berthing.

Vessel engines are to be tested when alongside with the Pilot onboard only.

Caution: Main engine immobilization is not permitted when alongside the Automated Vacuum Mooring System!

Note: Owners and charterers shall assess suitability before chartering the vessel, considering potential berthing in ports with new technologies.

## 9.4 Anchoring Procedures



### 9.4.1 Anchoring Procedure - rev 0 issued 09.12.2024

##### Anchoring Terms

###### Introduction

Use the below terms during anchoring. This will reduce mistakes caused by miscommunication.

###### Definitions

Anchor Aweigh: The anchor is said to be aweigh when it breaks out of the ground and is clear of the seabed.

Anchor Buoy: Indicates the position of the ship's anchor when on the bottom.

Anchor Dragging: The anchor is dragging when it is not held in the seabed. It is said to bite well when it has a good hold in the ground. The vessel is dragging her anchor if she moves her position while dragging the anchor over the seabed.

Brought Up: A vessel is brought up when her way has stopped, and she is riding to her anchor, with the anchor holding. The officer in charge will know when the vessel is brought up by the cable rising from the surface towards the hawse pipe when the brake is holding it. The vessel should then move towards the anchor, causing the cable to drop back and form a catenary.

Cable Clench: A strong steel forged fitting in the cable locker used for securing the bitter end of the cable.

.

Chain Hook: A long iron hook used for the manhandling of cable links.

Cross: Occurs when the cables are fouled as in foul hawse, forming a cross when the ship has swung through 180°.

Drop an Anchor under Foot: Let an anchor go to the bottom and hold on to the brake to steady the ship's head and prevent yawing. The second anchor is let go when the riding cable is growing right ahead.

Elbow: Occurs when the cables are fouled as in foul hawse, forming an elbow when the ship has swung through 360°.

Foul Anchor: When the anchor becomes caught on an underwater obstruction, often by an old hawser or cable.

Foul Hawse: The crossing of the anchor cables when both are being used simultaneously, caused by uncontrolled swinging of the vessel.

Grow: The cable is said to grow when the exposed part of the chain above the surface is seen to expand towards the anchor.

Gypsy: The vertical wheel on the windlass over which the cable passes, held by the clutch plate (when in gear) or by the brake (when about to be let go).

Hawse Pipes: Pipes on either bow accommodating the bow anchor. Some vessels may also have a stern anchor. The term is generally used for the stowage space for the anchors of a vessel.

Hove in Sight: When the anchor is hove home and sighted, clear at the point when the anchor crown shackle breaks the surface. Ensure the flukes are clear before considering the anchor is clear.

Long Stay: When the cable is leading down to the water close to the horizontal with weight on it. A good length of the cable is exposed.

Moored: A vessel is moored when she has two anchors down to the seabed.

Render Cable: Apply the brake lightly so that when weight comes on the cable, it runs out slowly.

Round Turn: Occurs when the cables are fouled as in foul hawse, with the ship having swung through 720° or twice around.

Scope: The amount of anchor cable payed out from the hawse pipe to the anchor crown D shackle.

Sheer: An angular movement of the vessel about the hawse pipe point, deliberately caused by applied helm to port or starboard.

Shorten Cable: Heave in a portion of the cable, reducing the scope.

Short Stay: The cable is at short stay when the anchor is hove in close to the ship's side and not over-extended. The cable is not up and down in this position.

Snub: To stop the cable from running out by applying the brake. A vessel snubs round on her anchor when she checks the paying out of the cable by applying the brake, causing the cable to act as a spring and turning the bow in the direction of the cable.

Spurling Pipes: The cable passes through these pipes from the windlass or cable holder to the cable locker.

Up and Down: The cable is up and down when the angle the cable makes with the water surface is 90°, usually just before anchor aweigh.

Walk Back the Anchor: Lower the anchor under power using the windlass motor.

Wind Rode: A vessel is wind rode when she is riding at anchor head to wind.

Yaw: A vessel yaws at anchor when she moves to port and starboard of the anchor position under the influence of wind and/or tide. Do not confuse yawing with sheering.

##### Anchoring

###### Introduction

The Master may decide to anchor for various reasons, such as:

- The berth or cargo is not available.

- The pilot is not available/boarding delayed.

- Machinery breakdown.

- Awaiting good weather/adverse weather.

- Voyage orders not available.

- In emergency

Plan an anchoring operation carefully:

- Collect information.

- Review instructions.

- Plan your approach.

- Decide on which method to be followed.

- Consider the prevailing weather conditions and sea state.

Consider following limitations:

- A windlass is designed to lift 3 shackles (82 meters) of cable, plus the anchor weight.

- The brake is designed to control the mass of the cable in motion, not the mass of the ship.

- The hydraulic motor speed is limited to 9 m/min (0.3 kts)

- The stopper arrangement is the strongest point of the system (80% of chain’s MBL)

- The brake holding capacity is 40% of chain’s MBL

- The hydraulic motor is the weakest part in the anchoring system

Plan to:

- Maneuver the vessel to the designated anchor position.

- Successfully anchor in a safe, seamanlike manner.

Accidents and incidents concerning anchoring are mainly caused by human error, such as:

- Anchoring in very deep waters.

- Only one man operating the brake.

- Excessive cable speed.

- Excessive ship’s speed.

- Windlass brake not maintained (not just the brake lining!).

- Excessive load on the windlass motor.

- Failure of associated equipment due to lack of maintenance.

###### Maximum Environmental Loads

IACS has unified rules for the design of anchoring equipment. The maximum environmental loads include the following specifications:

Harbor or sheltered anchorages:

- Current: 2.47 m/s or 4.8 knots

- Wind speed: 25 m/s or 48.6 knots (lower part of BF10)

- Good holding ground

- Wave height: 0 m

- Chain paid out to water depth ratio: 6:10

Open water anchorages (for vessels with equipment length greater than 135 M):

- Current: 1.55 m/s or 3 knots

- Wind speed: 11 m/s or 21.4 knots (upper part of BF5)

- Good holding ground

- Wave height: 2 m

- Chain paid out to water depth ratio: 6:10

Note: The equipment length of the ship is the length between perpendiculars but is not to be less than 96% nor greater than 97% of the extreme length on the Summer Load waterline (measured from the forward end of the waterline) - IACS rules UR-A1.

Caution: In poor holding ground, the holding power of the anchors is significantly reduced.

###### Responsibilities

The Master shall:

- Anchor the vessel safely.

- Set up anchor watches while at anchor.

- Abort/evacuate anchoring before onset of adverse environmental conditions by considering:

- Weather forecast.

- Predominant current rates.

- Anchor holding ground type.

Caution: Leave the anchorage before the environmental conditions approach the values provided in the "Maximum Environmental Loads" section.

There are cases when the scope of the chain used is restricted by:

- Congested anchorage area.

- Anchorage water depth, etc.

The Master shall exercise caution and select the best scope of chain to be used for anchoring depending on:

- Prevailing and expected weather conditions.

- Sea room for anchor position.

- Water depth.

- Anchor holding ground.

The Master shall use the same anchor (Port or Starboard) as the vessels in the vicinity to allow for a similar swinging direction and avoid dangerous stem-to-stem approach.

Note: Another useful guide in these situations is available in "Anchoring Practice" by Capt. Jerzy T. Idzikowski.

The OOW shall:

- Check the vessel's position frequently.

Completed

##### Anchoring Methods

###### Let Go Method

This method applies when anchoring in waters with a depth less than 50 meters.

Master shall:

Reduce vessel’s speed to zero.

Walk back the anchor in gear to about half shackle above the bottom.

Transfer the weight of the anchor and cable to the brakes.

Move the vessel astern at a speed of 0.25 – 0.5 knots.

Order Anchor Party to Let go on the brakes.

Control the speed of cable paying out using the brakes.

Control vessel’s astern movement.

Caution:

        - - Carry out a Risk Assessment to identify hazards and implement mitigating measures.

        - - Brief the Anchor Party on the anchoring procedure; avoid chain piling on top of anchor.

        - - Ensure the windlass brake band is in good condition and properly adjusted as per maker’s instructions.

        - - Train the crew to control the speed of the chain while paying it out using the brake.

        - - Consider having two persons to operate the brake for better control.

Let Go Anchor on Brake Procedure-Bridge

The master and OOW shall follow this procedure. This method is preferred when anchoring in depths less than 50 meters.

Approach the anchor position heading into the wind/tide or with wind/tide about 30 to 45 degrees on the bow.

Receive confirmation of readiness from forecastle.

Stop the ship over the ground (zero speed).

Instruct forecastle to lower anchor in gear till about half shackle above the bottom.

When the anchor is reported as on the brakes and ready to let go, instruct forecastle to let go the anchor and manoeuvre the vessel astern at an approximate speed of 0.25 – 0.5 knots to ensure the chain spreads over the bottom.

Use the main engines to control the motion over the ground.

Note: Avoid the piling of cable on the bottom by allowing the vessel to move astern to stretch the cable as it is paid out.

Obtain a precise position of the ship as soon as the anchor is dropped.

Draw a swinging circle.

Note: On the ECDIS, the bow position during initial walk-back will indicate the approximate position of the anchor.

Set up anchor watch on ECDIS from the bow position.

When securing cable, transfer the weight of anchor chain on the guillotine stopper whilst the chain is still leading close to vertical and tighten the brake.

Caution: Do not use / secure anchor lashings as additional holding power when vessel is anchored.

Display anchor ball by day or anchor lights at night.

Set notice for engine readiness.

Inform port authorities of the time and position anchored.

Change navigational status on AIS.

Caution:

Carry out a Risk Assessment to identify hazards and implement mitigating measures.

Brief the Anchor Party on the anchoring procedure.

Carefully consider the effect of environmental conditions on the vessel’s movement.

Use speed over ground information from GPS and Doppler Log to control the vessel.

Maintain the chain close to the “up and down” position throughout the entire process.

Walk Back Anchor Procedure-Bridge

The master and OOW shall follow this procedure. This method is preferred in depths above 50 meters. However, the Master can decide which method is more suitable, the “Walk Back” or the “Let Go”, based on the prevailing conditions and after finalizing the Risk Assessment.

Approach the anchor position heading into wind and tide or with wind/tide about 30 to 45 degrees on the bow.

Stop the ship over the ground (zero speed).

Instruct the forecastle to walk out the cable using the windlass motor all the way to the bottom.

Manoeuvre the vessel astern at a speed not exceeding 0.3 knots over ground while continuing to pay out the cable.

Maintain the cable leading close to “up and down” throughout the entire operation.

Monitor the vessel’s movement over the ground continually to avoid damage to the vessel’s windlass.

Use the main engine and the rudder judiciously to achieve desired speeds.

Once anchored, transfer the weight of the anchor chain to the guillotine stopper while the chain is still leading close to vertical and display anchor ball by day or anchor lights at night.

Set notice for engine readiness.

Inform port authorities of the time and position anchored.

Change navigational status on AIS.

Completed

Walk back Anchor Procedure-Forecastle

The C/O is the designated Anchor Party Leader. The Master may consider, for training purposes, another Deck Officer to assume this role under close supervision. The officer in charge on the forecastle shall follow this procedure.

Wait for the ship to be stopped over the ground.

Follow instructions to walk back the cable under power.

Report to the bridge:

Caution: The master shall control the vessel’s movement over ground not to exceed the windlass maximum speed.

If the cable is observed to stretch tight, inform the master to use the engines aggressively.

Use the windlass brake, if necessary, to control the speed of the cable and prevent overspeed of the motor.

Monitor the lead and weight of the cable closely.

On completion of anchoring, lock the cable stopper in position across the cable. Transfer the weight of anchor chain on the stopper whilst the chain is still leading close to vertical and tighten the brake.

Secure the hawse pipe cover.

Note: This prevents persons from boarding the vessel via the anchor cable.

Hoist the anchor ball.

Mark the cable with a flag visible from the bridge.

Note: Use this as an effective means of monitoring the anchor cable movement

  - Completed

##### Anchoring in Deep Waters

Prepare a detailed risk assessment considering:

- Condition of the vessel - ballast or laden

- Depth of water and evenness of the depth contour.

- Weather conditions.

- Currents.

- Nature of bottom/holding quality.

- Traffic density at the anchorage.

- Number of operational anchors.

- Scope of chain available for each anchor.

- Condition of the anchor, chain, windlass, and any repairs made.

- Condition of the anchor brake.

Plan the approach at safe speed.

When ready to anchor, ensure:

- Speed is almost zero over ground.

- Bow is not swinging.

- Vessel is on a steady heading similar to other vessels around or heading into the wind and current.

For anchoring large vessels, consult "Anchoring Systems and Procedures" (OCIMF) and "Anchoring Large Vessels" (Nautical Institute).

##### Emergency Preparedness

As part of contingency planning, keep the anchors ready for letting go in an emergency on arrival and departure port, when in anchoring depths.

Remove any wire lashings or other securing arrangements if applied.

Note: This requirement does not apply when the vessel is calling at an SBM terminal or navigating through oil fields.

###### Emergency Anchoring Guidelines

Emergency anchor dropping might be necessary in case of:

- Steering/main engine failure.

- Probable collision.

- Maneuvering in shallow waters.

- Drifting to shallow waters in heavy weather.

In such situations, quick action is required:

- Use both anchors simultaneously if danger is imminent.

- If time allows, call for assistance, study the charts, and drop both anchors with a short internal delay to triangulate. Aim for a 1:3 depth/chain ratio or better.

Note: The goal is to enable the ship anchor to drag along the seabed, providing maximum resistance to the vessel’s movement without causing damage.

##### Other Conditions

###### Prolonged anchoring

Conduct a Risk Assessment considering:

- Depth of water.

- Anchor holding ground nature.

- Exposure to environmental conditions.

- Wind and current direction.

- Ship’s behaviour while at anchor.

Based on this assessment, the Master should:

- Establish monitoring and reporting requirements by the OOW.

- Analyze vessel’s movement while at anchor daily.

- Decide on the frequency of re-anchoring to avoid anchor fouling by chain.

- Decide if drifting is safer than remaining at anchor.

Note: Avoid using excessive length of anchor chain in shallow waters, generally maintaining a 6:1 depth ratio. In anchorages where wind and current direction do not change significantly, paying out additional chain may help avoid dragging. The OOW should monitor not only for anchor dragging but also the vessel’s movement relative to the anchor position to evaluate the risk of chain fouling. If the vessel rides the anchor in a 360° or unpredictable pattern, re-anchoring more frequently may be necessary.

##### Anchor Watch

###### Introduction

An anchor watch is essential to ensure the vessel remains safely anchored.

Set up an anchor watch as soon as the vessel is safely anchored.

A deck officer must always be on the bridge at anchor and alert to changes in weather conditions that could affect safe anchorage.

Anchor Watch Procedure

The OOW shall follow this procedure:

Establish required parameters on ECDIS or draw a swinging circle on the chart.

Plot the ship's position at regular intervals to ensure the vessel maintains her position.

Set anchor watch alarm in:

ECDIS

GPS

Keep the course recorder switched on.

Note: This helps monitor the direction of swing.

Operate radar while at anchor.

Monitor other vessels in the area to foresee possible close-quarter situations.

Use fixed objects to monitor the vessel’s position by:

Radar ranges

Radar bearings

If there is any indication the anchor is dragging, call the:

Master

Duty engineer

Chief engineer

Note: Prepare the engine and put it on standby.

Monitor vessel’s behavior while at anchor. Inform the Master if:

The vessel revolves around the anchor position on a 360° pattern.

The bow (chain) repeatedly passes over the anchor position.

Note: This movement could render the anchor fouled by the chain. The Master may decide to re-anchor the vessel.

Keep a continuous VHF watch on:

Channel 16

Any appropriate frequency required by the local authority.

When relieved, inspect:

The windlass

Anchor cable

If there is a potential pirate threat:

Operate the second radar on a short range to detect small craft.

Wash the mud from the chain.

Note: Use additional hoses to wash the chain, if necessary.

Report to the bridge when each joining shackle is picked up to deck.

Report to the bridge when the anchor is sighted and clear.

- Lower the anchor ball or switch off anchor lights.

Secure the cable when the anchor is home.

Completed

##### Heaving Anchor in Heavy Weather

###### Introduction

Move out of an exposed anchorage before the onset of bad weather. Use this procedure to prevent damage to windlass system:

- In bad weather

- Strong current

- Strong tide conditions

- When the vessel is rolling heavily

Consider below conditions to set up operational safeguards and abort/evacuate anchoring before bad weather comes

- Current: 1,54 m/s or 3 knots

- Wind speed: 11 m/s or 21.4 knots (upper part of BF5)

- Wave height: 2 m

- Ratio of chain paid out to water depth 6

Master should decide if to remain at anchor or put to sea, due to:

- Deterioration of visibility

- In advance of adverse weather conditions

- If the vessel's safe anchorage might be affected

Heave Anchor in Heavy Weather Guidance

Master and OOW shall follow these guidelines. The C/O is the designated Anchor Party Leader.

If weather conditions or forecasts exceed the design limits:

Keep the main engine on standby.

Check with agents on the availability of tugs at short notice (where applicable).

Prepare to release the bitter end of the cable as per guidelines.

Warm the hydraulic windlass by circulation before use.

Maintain good communication between the bridge and the officer on the forecastle regarding:

The position of the cable.

Load on the cable.

Use the main engine to:

Prevent large load on the cable during recovery.

Keep the cable vertical.

Caution: Do not allow shock loading of the windlass hydraulic motor.

Keep the control lever at the full heave position during recovery.

If the windlass hydraulic motor stops due to heavy load:

Immediately tighten the brake or use the cable stopper.

Release the control lever to the neutral position.

Note: This will stop the motor from going into reverse over-speed, damaging the motor. The stopper is designed to withstand 80% of the MBL of the anchor chain, whereas a properly adjusted windlass brake is designed to render at 45% MBL.

Caution:

Do not de-ballast prior to going alongside a berth if bad weather is forecast as it may:

Increase the vessel's movement in rough weather.

Put additional load on the cable.

Do not attempt to control the mass of the ship using the brake or the hydraulic motor, as serious damage to the windlass system may occur.

##### Anchor Slipping / Bitter End Disconnection Guidelines

There can be the case that the anchor cannot be recovered, being fouled.

The master can decide to disconnect the anchor chain from the bitter end to enable the vessel to move.

If such a scenario needs to be implemented

Master shall:

- Use main engines and maneuver the vessel as required

- Keep minimum tension on the chain

- Keep the chain as vertical as possible

- Coordinate with the Chief Officer

The Chief Officer shall:

- Lower the chain until approximately 1 shackle remains inside the spurling pipe and apply the brake.

- Connect a messenger rope with sufficient length, depending on the depth of water, to an anchor buoy and anchor chain. This will be used to recover the anchor later.

- Lower the rope through the hawse pipe.

- Use the hammer provided to remove the bitter end securing pin and remove the pin

- Slowly open the brake and keep clear of the winch area when the chain is observed running.

- Let the cable run all the way to the water and through the hawse pipe.

##### Securing the Anchor

###### Introduction

Secure anchors and chains to prevent damage to the anchor and hull.

Note: Anchors should be checked to ensure the correct position in the hawse pipe to avoid free movement.

Secure Anchors Procedure

The IDF foreman and deck crew must carry out this process.

The IDF foreman and deck crew must carry out this process.

Secure the anchor and chains before the vessel proceeds on sea passage.

Get approval from the master or OOW before securing anchors.

Ensure the bow chain stopper is in position with the pin locked.

Lash the anchor chains to the bow chain stopper or designated securing points.

Cover the spurling pipes.

Seal the spurling pipes with cement.

Cover the hawse pipes.

Completed

##### Loss of Anchor and Chain Procedure

The master and OOW shall follow these guidelines.

Confirm the ship’s position.

Record the position and time in the logbook.

If possible, throw in an anchor buoy.

Note: This will assist in a later recovery attempt.

Take appropriate measures to secure the safety of the vessel.

If the loss of the anchor and chain resulted from the navigation of another vessel:

Record:

The name of the opposing ship

Its owner

Charterer

Port of registry

Last port of call

Next port of call

Tender a letter of protest to the master of the opposing ship.

Try and obtain a signature from the master of the opposing ship.

Make an initial report to the company.

Report further developments to the company from time to time.

Report the circumstances which led to the loss of the anchor and chain so that the company can determine whether general average is affected or not.

##### Use of Anchors for Mooring

###### Anchor Assisted Berthing

Vessels sometimes use the seaward anchor, in conjunction with mooring lines, to haul the vessel out of the jetty while casting off or while making fast alongside to assist in controlling the rate of lateral movement towards the berth. This manoeuvre can be done with or without tug assistance.

Vessels generally approach with the berth on their port side.

When about 50 meters off the berth, the starboard anchor is dropped and kept paid out.

Close to the berth, the cable is checked using the engines to control the ship’s speed and to swing the stern towards the berth. Mooring lines are used to haul the vessel towards the berth and secure it.

When unberthing, after casting off all lines, the anchor is heaved up to pull the bow off the berth.

The engines are used, along with the rudder, to move the stern away from the berth.

###### Running Moor

The running mooring takes relatively short duration and offers more control of the vessel.

The vessel’s starboard anchor is let go at a position approximately four to five shackles from the final position of the bow and around nine shackles paid out while moving ahead on engines.

As she falls astern with the tide, the port anchor is let go and the starboard anchor is heaved on to five shackles. This method restricts the swinging room and reduces the load on the windlass.

###### Standing Mooring

This method is practiced during cross winds.

As the vessel is stopped, the port anchor is let go and around nine shackles are paid out with the tide.

The starboard anchor is let go and simultaneously the port anchor is heaved on. The port anchor is kept on four shackles, being generally the flood anchor, and the starboard on five as it is the ebb anchor.

This manoeuvre takes a longer duration and provides less control over the vessel. The load on the windlass is more compared to the running moor.

###### Conventional Buoy or Multi Buoy Mooring

In this method, the bow of the ship is secured using both her anchors, whereas the stern is secured to buoys around it.

The vessel approaches the final berthing position from forward at an angle of 90 degrees to her final direction of berthing.

The starboard anchor is let go first at a predicted spot while the ship is making headway.

The required amount of cable is paid out and astern propulsion is operated simultaneously to stop the vessel.

Once the vessel is stopped in the water, the port anchor is let go and the vessel positions her stern along the centreline bifurcating the buoys. For aligning the vessel along this centreline, the port cable is paid out and the starboard cable is heaved in with astern propulsion.

Use the helm and engines carefully during this manoeuvre to ensure the stern swings clear of any of the buoys.

During unberthing, the anchor cables are heaved in to move the vessel forward, and the weight is taken on windward lines while casting off other lines to prevent the stern from swinging into other buoys.

This manoeuvre requires skill and efficient operation of the ship’s crew as well as the mooring equipment, as the weight of the lines can often be immense.

##### Maintenance and inspection

Carry out regular inspections and maintenance of anchor windlasses in accordance with instructions and intervals given in PMS and as per the manufacturer instruction manual.

##### Training

Masters and all deck officers are required to do the following OLP training.

- No. 0825 – Safe Anchoring

Inspection and Maintenance of mooring equipment training is available in OLP:

- No. 0371 – Safe Anchoring

- No. 372 – Mooring, Equipment inspection

##### Engine Room Watchkeeping

###### Introduction

The chief engineer shall create an engine room watch schedule, considering:

- The experience of the watchkeepers involved.

- The provisions of the STCW code and ILO convention for minimum rest periods.

- Inclusion of the chief engineer in the watch-keeping routine if necessary to assist engineers with heavy workloads or to ensure adequate rest.

The chief engineer, especially on ships with only two watch-keeping engineers, should consider including himself in the schedule during:

- Prolonged periods of manned engine room operation due to critical equipment failures, breakdowns, or operational requirements.

- Prolonged pilotage or standby periods.

###### Responsibilities

Chief Engineer: Ensure a safe and efficient engine room watch-keeping routine onboard the vessel, including standby ratings whom the duty engineer may call for assistance. Assess each engineer to ensure they are capable of keeping a watch.

Duty Engineer (EOOW): Responsible to the chief engineer for the safe and efficient operation of all machinery and plant.

Note: The term duty engineer applies equally to vessels operating a manned or unmanned engine room system.

Watch-keeping in Engine-Room Procedure

The chief engineer and engineer officers shall do this procedure.

Continuous Manning of the Engine Room

The engine room shall be manned continuously under the following conditions:

- When under standby and maneuvering conditions.

- When navigating in areas of heavy congestion, restricted waters, or poor visibility.

- When requested by the Master.

- When deemed appropriate by the chief engineer, including:

- Periods when critical safety equipment or devices in the engine room, such as oil mist detectors and fire detectors, are non-operational or unreliable.

- Periods when key machinery, such as propulsion machinery, boilers, or electrical equipment, is not fully operational or where associated automation is defective.

- Periods when the vessel’s UMS (Unmanned Machinery Space) notation has been suspended or removed.

- Periods of heavy weather when machinery operation may be affected.

- Periods of bunkering, ballast or cargo operations, tank cleaning operations, and whenever the inert gas plant is operational.

UMS Mode: When in UMS mode, the EOOW (Engineer Officer of the Watch) is responsible for 24 hours, normally starting at 08:00 each day.

Note: During normal working hours (till 17:00), the EOOW is in the engine room. After that time and until the following morning, the EOOW maintains readiness to respond to any emergency condition or alarm and arranges for regular visits to the engine room, and safety rounds according to the chief engineer’s instructions.

The chief engineer shall post a signed watch plan for both E/R operating modes. The following table guides the composition of the E/R watch in certain operations:

* The Master shall decide the composition of the E/R Team in consultation with C/E

** It may be 4th Eng (Dry Cargo Vessels)

Manned Operation: When in manned operation, the EOOW oversees engine room operations until relieved. The EOOW must:

- Keep the chief engineer fully informed of the performance of the machinery.

- Call the chief engineer or a senior engineer if in any doubt.

- Take immediate action if the safety of the ship is concerned and inform the chief engineer immediately.

- Inform the bridge as soon as possible if a situation in the machinery space may affect the speed, maneuverability, power supply, or other essentials for the safe operation of the ship. This notification should preferably be made before making any changes, to enable the bridge to take appropriate action.

- Be familiar with the location of all firefighting and other safety equipment in the machinery spaces and be proficient in operating them.

Note: All staff must be aware of the escape routes from the machinery space and ensure these are always kept clear.

- Operate, adjust, and monitor all machinery and plant according to laid-down procedures to ensure efficient performance.

- Promptly carry out any orders from the bridge by the master or OOW and inform the chief engineer promptly.

- Make appropriate entries in the engineer's logbook.

- Maintain frequent engine room rounds and verify the correct operation of systems and machinery.

- Investigate any abnormalities immediately and rectify them as appropriate.

- Inform the chief engineer of any problems encountered and actions taken.

- Be aware of the status of the vessel with special regard to fire detectors, fire alarms, and other emergency indicators.

Note: If the EOOW needs to off-scan any alarm, he should inform the chief engineer. An alarm may, at the chief engineer's discretion, be off-scanned for a maximum of 24 hours. Thereafter, the chief engineer shall follow the Management of Change procedure until normal conditions are restored.

Completed

##### Maintenance during Watch-keeping Routines Guidance

The EOOW shall follow these guidelines. Senior engineers shall develop procedures for each ship to meet the following objectives:

- Safe operation

- Reliability

- Performance to meet operational requirements

- Efficiency in terms of fuel costs, maintenance, and spare parts

Consider the instructions and recommendations contained in the manufacturer’s manuals and any other relevant documents, especially the methods of monitoring machinery performance.

Carry out general repair or maintenance tasks.

Note: These must not interfere with the safekeeping of the watch.

Correct any malfunctions or breakdowns if possible, and where applicable, note details in the planned maintenance system (PMS defects record).

Check all machinery and plants systematically. Report any abnormalities to the chief engineer without delay.

Complete the logbook at the end of each watch. If any parameters or readings are outside the recommended values, inform the chief engineer or a senior engineer.

For UMS ships, fill in the appropriate checklists at 23-07 hrs, 12-13 hrs, and 17-22 hrs.

Examine the cylinder lubricators for satisfactory operation. Examine the telescopic piston-cooling pipes and the scraper glands for piston rods, where applicable, for excessive leakage.

Take soundings of lubricating oil drain tanks at 23-07 hrs, 12-13 hrs, and 17-22 hrs, and before/after each transfer operation.

If lubricating oil filters are of the edgewise-cleaning type, give the handles a few turns every watch. Regularly observe indicator filters operating at the designed pressure differential. Observe automatic or back-flushing filters for proper operation.

Check fuel oil and lubricating oil filters and pressures regularly. Clean the filters at intervals determined by the ship's installation, bunker quality, and movement of the ship.

During Maneuvering Procedure

The chief engineer shall take overall charge of the engine room. The EOOW shall assist the chief engineer and do the following:

- The engine control room shall be appropriately manned during maneuvering. If for some exceptional reason, the control room or console must be left unmanned, inform the bridge and agree on a method of emergency communication.

- Check the air inlet pipes of the main engine starting valves regularly. If any high temperatures are noted, replace the valve at the next opportunity.

- Observe the operation of the main engine fuel valves regularly.

- Maintain the main engine cooling water temperature constant at the recommended temperature.

- Ensure the proper operation of the automatic temperature control valves and steam heating.

- Maintain frequent engine room rounds and verify the correct operation of systems and machinery.

- Before entry into port or when the vessel is approaching shallow water, open the high seawater suction valve and close the low seawater suction valve to minimize the inflow of sand or silt.

- If the vessel is engaged in long periods of slow maneuvering, the main engine exhaust passages will likely become fouled. Contact the bridge early to see if it is possible to plan a short period at full speed to help alleviate the problem.

Completed

##### Operation at Economical Speed

- Economical speed is attained when the main engine is operated for a prolonged period at an rpm where the total fuel oil consumption for the vessel is minimized.

- Running at economical speed must not cause damage or excessive fouling of the main engine or require the engine to be operated in the barred speed range.

- Adjust the cylinder oil feed rate appropriately.

- Operating the main engine at certain speeds may require putting main engine auxiliary blowers, generators, boilers, etc., on load, which can make it uneconomical.

- Refer to IMS procedure “9.1.5 – Difficult conditions” for more information about speed in different scenarios.

### 10.1.10 Boilers Management - rev 0 issued 13.12.2024

##### Boilers

###### Introduction

Marine boiler plants require adequate control systems to raise steam, maintain design conditions for steady steaming, secure the boiler units, and promptly detect any malfunctions and failures.

The automatic control arrangement on a shipboard boiler is divided into two parts:

- Safety System: This system ensures all values are within predetermined limits and provides automatic alarms if any values deviate. It also initiates an automatic burner trip in case of a dangerous situation.

- Continuous Control: This involves the continuous monitoring and control of various parameters such as water level, steam pressure, fuel oil pressure, fuel oil temperature, blowdown, and superheat temperature.

The combustion control system maintains constant steam pressure by controlling the flow of air and oil to the burner.

Advanced combustion controls transmit the air and oil loadings simultaneously, with a slight lag between air and oil. This ensures that with an increased boiler load, the air leads the oil, and with a decreased load, the oil leads the air.

This arrangement minimizes smoke emissions during maneuvering. Classification societies have specific requirements for marine applications due to the environment and the fact that assistance is not available while sailing at sea.

###### Test to Determine Safe Light-Up of the First Burner

The chief engineer plans the test and shall:

Note: Safely shut off the fuel supply to the burner before the test.

- Power up the boiler control system.

- Start the burner.

- Start a stopwatch when the combustion air damper reaches its maximum position.

- Stop the stopwatch when the combustion air damper begins to close again, and note the purge time. The air in the furnace should be changed at least five times during the pre-purge period.

Note: Find the furnace volume and the fan capacity from the documentation and calculate the required purge time. The time must never be less than the minimum specified in the manuals, even if your calculation indicates otherwise.

- Start the stopwatch again when the automatic fuel oil shutoff valves open.

- Stop the stopwatch when the fuel oil shutoff valves close and you get a flame failure or misfiring alarm and note the trail-for-ignition time. If the time exceeds the maker's setup (e.g., fifteen seconds), do not ignite the burner until the time has been adjusted. Five seconds is a typical trail-for-ignition time, but different classification societies specify different maximum times. Check the rules of the relevant classification society for the correct maximum time.

Note: This shutoff delay is only allowed during trail-for-ignition. If a flame failure occurs during normal firing, the fuel oil valves must shut off instantly.

####### Additional Safety Checks

- The fuel oil flow during light-up must not exceed 20% of the full load flow. However, burners with a limited turndown ratio must be accepted.

- A corrupt flow transmitter signal may cause severe problems, therefore:

- When purging the furnace with air prior to lighting up, confirm the position of the combustion air damper with a limit switch rather than relying solely on the air flow transmitter's signal.

- At burner light-up, confirm the position of the fuel oil control valve and the combustion air damper with limit switches rather than relying solely on the flow transmitters' signals. Use the transmitters' signals but confirm them with limit switches.

- Direct the light from a flashlight onto the flame scanner sensors when the burner is off to confirm that the auto-check function works correctly and triggers an alarm. If any other action occurs, such as opening the fuel valves, the system needs thorough improvement.

Using the igniter during the post-purge of the last burner's lance (or a single burner's lance) has disadvantages. Upon resetting the system after a flame failure, the igniter may start firing before the furnace has been properly purged with air, posing a risk of furnace explosions.

####### Consider the Following

- A well-tried method is to purge the fuel line and the burner lance slowly to let the fuel continue to burn without igniter support until the lance is empty.

- Not purging the burner lance at all is another method, but it requires standby heating of the tubing and the lance to keep the fuel sufficiently heated.

- Whatever method is used, ensure the igniter does not start before the furnace has been properly purged with air.

##### Boiler Water Treatment

Test boiler water daily on steaming boilers, feed, and condensate systems, and weekly on any boiler in wet lay-up.

###### Testing

Test as indicated in the relevant instructions issued by the chemical supply company.

- On vessels with turbine-driven cargo pumps, check the total dissolved solids (TDS) with the provided instrument.

- Forward the results directly to the chemical supply company each month, with a copy to the office. File a copy on board as per the standard shipboard filing system.

- Maintain a separate form for each boiler.

###### Treatment

- Do not dose oxygen scavenger to the "steaming boiler" based on onboard company investigations.

- Always maintain chemical reserves in the feed system within the range stipulated by the chemical supply company.

- The test results will determine the dosage of chemicals to the boiler, feed, and condensate systems.

- Monitor subsequent results to check that the addition of chemicals is having the required effect.

- Blow down boilers and scum regularly to maintain the TDS and chloride levels within the prescribed maximum limit. About two tons of water must be blown down or scummed out of each boiler at least once a week, even if the chloride and TDS levels are within limits. The total amount of water to be blown down depends on the boiler capacity.

- Maintain the feed water temperature as high as possible without causing cavitation of the feed pumps - the minimum achievable will be approximately 65°C, but where possible maintain a figure of 85°C.

- Keep lids and hatches of hot wells closed.

- Operate the salinity alarms fitted to the feed system and rectify faults with this equipment as soon as possible. The designated engineer shall test the salinity of the boiler water daily.

- Operate the oil detection equipment, if fitted, to the feed system and rectify any faults with this equipment as soon as possible. The EOOW shall visually check the hot well for evidence of oil leakage.

- The chemical supply company replies/comments directly to the vessel, with a copy to the office.

- The office and the chemical supply company review these logs. The chief engineer is responsible for monitoring the logs and initiating immediate investigation/corrective action if problems are noted.

##### Short-Term Wet Lay-Up

- On vessels with two boilers (excluding the economizer), whenever one boiler is taken out of service and shut down after the vessel has completed her cargo discharge program, the idle boiler is to be placed into wet lay-up.

- When a boiler is to be shut down and left idle for up to one month, it is to be kept in the wet lay-up condition.

- After any work requiring emptying the boiler is completed, refill the boiler and keep it in the wet lay-up condition.

- During the lay-up period, inspect and remove soot deposits from the gas side.

- After shutting down the boiler as per the manufacturer’s instructions, dose it with an oxygen scavenging chemical according to the chemical supply company’s instructions, then fill it until water issues from the air vent of the steam drum.

Note: Dose the boiler with oxygen scavenging chemicals separately and not in combination with any other treatment chemical.

Note: Flush the dosing equipment thoroughly before dosing the oxygen scavenger.

- Secure the boiler and keep it full of water during the lay-up period.

- Test boiler water weekly.

##### Soot Blowing

At Sea

- Before operating the soot blowers, contact the OOW and obtain permission to operate the soot blowers (“blowing tubes”) to allow the vessel to alter course and let the soot fall clear of the vessel if required.

- Soot blow the in-service boiler once per day or as per the manufacturer’s instructions, paying particular attention to the correct draining of the soot-blowing steam.

- Soot blow the boiler no more than 12 hours before the vessel’s scheduled arrival in port.

- The EOOW shall supervise all soot-blowing operations and record them in the engine room logbook.

In Port: Do not soot blow when the vessel is approaching/leaving port with a pilot on board or in the port itself.



### 10.1.2 Planning Procedure - rev 0 issued 13.12.2024

##### Fuel Oil Management

###### Introduction

This procedure gives guidance on the handling and management of all types of fuel oil on board the vessel.

Definitions

VLSFO – Heavy Fuel oil - less than 0.5% Sulphur content by mass .

ULSFO – Ultra low Sulphur fuel oil (Sulphur content less than 0.1% by mass)

MGO – Marine gas oil (no more than 0.5% of Sulphur content, conforming to ISO 8217 Grade DMA, 2012

LSMGO – Low Sulphur marine gas oil (Sulphur content less than 0.1% by mass)

###### Responsibilities

The chief engineer is responsible for all aspects fuel oil management including:

- Ordering

- Bunkering

- Internal Fuel/Luboil Transfers

- Quality verification

- Storage

- Efficient use

- Compliance with regulations regarding quality of fuel to be used

The Master is responsible to ensure that his vessel has sufficient bunkers to safely carry out the proposed voyage considering:

- Length of the voyage;

- Expected prevailing weather conditions;

- Expected consumptions during the proposed voyage;

- Speed, condition of the vessel (laden or ballast condition), tank cleaning, heating, etc.

- Availability or not of receiving additional bunkers during this voyage if necessary;

- Quality of the bunkers as specified in the MARPOL Annex VI requirements; and

- Area of trading so as to specify the necessary quality of fuel with respect to the sulfur content.

###### Guidelines For Bunker Reserve

The chief engineer shall follow these guidelines

Note:	The reserve bunker quantity can include a single or a combination of ULSFO grades available in ship’s bunker tanks or LSMGO. Confirm this with technical and operations departments.

- Co-ordinate the reserve with technical and operations departments due to safety and commercial feasibility.

- Order bunkers (fuel oil, marine diesel oil or gas oil) that conform to the international and regional quality requirements regarding SOx emissions.

- The below table shows the applicable “Sulphur” limits allowed in the various areas and for the various grades depending on the regulations in force:

*A Global Sulphur cap in ECA areas will still apply

Marine Fuel Oil Sulphur Record Book

Establish a change-over procedure when changing fuel oil grades due to:

- Geographical areas with different regulatory requirements

- Quality and Sulphur content being different

Keep records on-board with data for:

- Bunker Details

- BDN and MARPOL sample

- Fuel oil change-over record (for vessels sailing in ECA)-1

- Log with fuel used in ECA-1

- Fuel oil change-over record (for vessels sailing in Californian waters)-1

- Fuel oil change-over record for vessels entering Chinese Domestic ECA-1

- Log with fuel used in Californian waters-1

- Fuel oil change-over record (for vessels ‘at berth’ in Hong Kong, EU or Turkish ports)-2

- Log with fuel used in EU or Turkish ports-2

- Fuel oil change-over record (for vessels sailing in South Korean ECA

- Log with fuel used in South Korean ECA

Record the above data:

- In the Marine Fuel oil Sulphur Record Book issued by Lloyd’s Register / FOBAS

- Using company specific format

Note 1:		Allow sufficient time for fuel change-over to ensure that prior to crossing the borderline of the regulated area, the whole fuel system is flushed from the fuel used before.

Note 2:		These records do not need to provide time for system’s flushing from the fuel used before, as the change-over should take place as soon as after berthing and upon completion of manoeuvring operations (and vice-versa).

###### Bunker Reserve ULSFO and/or ULSMGO

ECA regulations require vessels to be supplied with ULSFO or ULSMGO having Sulphur content <0.10% while trading in these areas.  Vessels calling Chines DECA should have fuel with Sulphur content <0.5%.

ECA includes:

- The waters covered by the North and Baltic Seas, as defined by MARPOL Annex VI and

- The area of the North American waters adjacent to the Pacific coast, the Atlantic/Gulf coast including Puerto Rico and the eight main Hawaiian Islands

Note:	It extends up to 200 nautical miles from coasts of the United States, Canada and the French territories, except that it does not extend into marine areas subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of other States.

Ships shall use, for engines and boilers, fuel with a content of Sulphur < 0.10% in these waters.

In ECA regions have on board, in addition to the expected quantity necessary to perform the actual voyage, a reserve of ULSFO or ULSMGO to ensure minimum 2 days of steaming at instructed speed.

Note:	This margin should cover the consumption incurred due to bad weather, unplanned deviations, anchorages or extended cargo operations.

If vessel exits ECA, the unused ULSFO or ULSMGO could form part of reserve fuel required in guidelines given above.

While in EU ports situated outside ECA, exchange the fuel as soon as possible after arrival to berth or sheltered anchorage area and as late as possible before unmooring or leaving anchorage area.

Note:	The regulation does not apply to vessels during manoeuvring.

To comply with the EU ports fuel regulations, when ordering bunkers the ship shall consider the necessary quantity of ULSFO or ULSMGO needed for the operation and a reserve sufficient to cover consumption for A/E(s) and boiler(s) for minimum 6 days idling at anchor or alongside.

To comply with Chinese DECA regulations, when ordering bunkers, the ship shall consider the necessary quantity of ULSFO or ULSMGO needed for the operation, for maneuvering and a reserve sufficient to cover consumption for A/E(s) and boiler(s) for minimum7 days idling at anchor or alongside.

Keep on board a reserve of ULSMGO sufficient to operate M/E, A/Es for a period of minimum 24 hours in case of emergency.

Note:	This is in addition to the reserves required for ECA areas and in case of boiler failure, when vessel cannot heat up bunkers.

##### Use of Fuel Additives

Based on results of fuel quality analysis the necessity, type and quantity of additives to be used will be decided in conjunction with advice from the ship’s Technical Superintendent.

##### Storage and Handling of Fuel Oil

Each vessel shall have bunker transfer procedures for daily internal bunker transfer.  The EOOW should understand and sign this procedure.

Take care with heating of bunkers especially that stored in tanks immediately adjacent to cargo tanks. There have been cases recorded of cargo being damaged by excessive temperatures in fuel oil tanks.

In general, store fuel oil at a temperature of around 10 degrees centigrade above pour point. Heat only the tank that is actually in use and usually not any higher than 50 degrees centigrade. Always see the fuel oil analysis result “Engineering Note”.

Take care that the heating coils in empty tanks are closed at both the steam and condensate ends. If the main engine is under full load, do not circulate any over production of steam through fuel oil tanks. This applies in case when the steam system is not provided with steam dumping pressure control valve.

VLSFO and ULSFO may require recirculation from the storage tank back to the same tank:

- To avoid precipitation, hence sludge formation.

- To create homogeneous mixture

Once pumped to a settling tank, allow sufficient time for any free water or solid particles to settle to the bottom of the tank and be drained off, before putting the tank into use. Keep the temperature of oil in the settling tank around 60-75 degrees centigrade – subject to grade of fuel oil.

After several fillings, drain tanks regularly of both water and a small amount of fuel, to remove the aluminum/silicon deposits.

Note:	While the original bunker fuel may meet the required specifications and the onboard purification system is satisfactory, failure to drain the settling tank regularly will lead to engine wear. 
If the draining procedure is not followed, the high Aluminum/ Silicone fuel level can increase until it reaches the suction pipe and at this point the engine is fed. This then causes the liners and piston rings to wear quickly.

Once in a while take samples from the service tank at about the suction pipe level and get it analyzed. This will give an idea on how frequently to drain or if the regular draining has been done.

Maintain fuel oil purifiers as required so that they perform efficiently. Run purifiers continuously and at least as long as the main engine is in operation. See laboratory result “Engineering Note “of new fuel oil bunker..

Considering the design of the purifiers, use the appropriate gravity disc for different grades of fuel to ensure good separation of impurities.

For heavy fuel, maintain a temperature of 95-98 degree centigrade during separation.

Note:	Always see laboratory analysis result “Engineering Note “and follow up their advice.

Avoid comingling of heavy fuel oils wherever possible. Note the following:

- Commingling of small amounts of heavy fuel oil grades from different sources may be unavoidable. This refers to un-pumpable quantities remaining in a nominally empty tank

- Consider commingling ratios of less than approximately 10% or more than 90% on a case by case basis, taking into account the fuel properties, compatibility test results. Consult the technical department.
Also consult technical department for permission to comingle other ratios

Warning!

Do not comingle distillate fuels with heavy fuel oils.

- Avoid comingling of ULSFO with any other ULSFO (including ULSFO from a different source)

- When loading LSMGO or ULSFO into a tank which has carried other grades, take care to ensure that the tank is empty and as clean as possible. If extensive cleaning is required, discuss and review the procedures with the responsible technical superintendent. Even small traces of higher Sulphur fuel can put the incoming fuel “off spec”

- To avoid accidental comingling, when switching fuels, bunkering, storing and transferring of fuels of different grades, all blanks shall be in place and spool pieces removed as per design or sanctioned, modified designs

- When transferring or bunkering fuels, carefully monitor the levels of all tanks (not just the tank being loaded).
Avoid accidental filling of the wrong tank, either through human error or faulty equipment (leaking valves).

- Receive MGO through the dedicated MGO bunkering line, where available. If bunkering ULSFO or any other fuel through a line that has previously been used for HFO, drain this line completely. Bunker operation of ULSFO is subject to design of the system. Consult with the technical superintendent.

- Considering the complexities of carrying different grades, nominate one person to oversee all storage and transfers of fuels on board

- Prepare drawings of fuel system which highlight lines and valve positions for different modes of operation (ULSMGO, HFO, ULSFO) Display the relevant drawing in the engine control room and change whenever the fuel in use is changed.

VLSFO to LSMGO (0.10% Sulphur content) Fuel Changeover Procedure

The chief engineer shall do this procedure.

- Submit the plan for changeover from VLSFO to LSMGO in advance to the technical superintendent.

- Include the estimated time when changing over will commence and be completed.

- Take all possible steps to prevent accidental contamination of the LSMGO.

- Verify all blanks and spool pieces within the fuel system are in place.

- Take precaution against accidental heating of the LSMGO. This should include removal of inlet, outlet valves and installation of blind flanges of the tank heating coils and the trace heating systems.

Note:	It is not enough to isolate any system by closing a valve. At the very least shut and seal the valves and where possible positively isolate the lines.  The removal of a spool piece is preferred. Application of spectacle blanks is preferred to a spade blank.

- Test available methods of cooling the LSMGO.

- Follow the engine manufacturer’s instructions and guidance from the ship builder

- During changing over the temperature, limit the rate of change to around 2°C/min or as otherwise stated by the engine manufacturers.

- Recognize that there is an increased risk of filter clogging and leakage during the change-over period. Monitor all equipment closely.

- Reduce the engine load for the duration of the changeover, as far as practicable.

- Prepare a risk assessment related to the changeover process and operation on LSMGO.

- Consider use of an approved lubricity enhancer where the viscosity of the LSMGO is close to 2cST at 40 deg C

- Carry out change from LSMGO to HFO taking similar care and paying attention to the same items as above.

- The valves in use should have a prominent label attached to ensure that everybody knows that they are the valves in use while the vessel is operating on LSHFO or LSMGO.

##### Lubricating Oils and Lubricants

###### Introduction

This procedure ensures that the vessel always has adequate quantities of lubricating oils and lubricants on board and that the quality of lubricating oil is maintained.

###### Responsibilities

The chief engineer

- Shall order and control lubricating oils and lubricants.

The chief officer

- Shall order any lubricating oil and lubricants, required for the deck department, through the chief engineer.

###### Lubricating Oil – Reserve Policy

Where practical and possible keep minimum and maximum quantities of lubricants for main grades as below:

Main engine system oil- Sufficient lubricating oil on board to at least recharge the system to a normal working level.

Main Engine Cylinder Lube Oil – Normally sufficient for 60 days steaming at full speed.

Auxiliary engine system oil - Sufficient lubricating oil on board for:

- Minimum: 100% recharge of one auxiliary engine

- Maximum: No limit but be guided by the 3-4 months requirement so that supply is done together with other lubricants. The chief engineers should be also guided by the minimum bulk oil quantity as defined by the oil companies

Hydraulic oil for critical equipment - Sufficient hydraulic oil (of each grade) on board to:

- Minimum: Fully recharge the critical hydraulic systems (e.g. steering gear, mooring equipment, hatch covers, cranes and remote control valves)

NOTE:	Vessels with multiple hydraulic systems, (i.e. mooring equipment fwd, mooring equipment aft, etc.), shall have sufficient quantity onboard for 100% recharge of the largest system, if the oil grade of the largest system is compatible with the other systems. Discuss and agree with the technical superintendent.

Refrigeration compressor oil

- Minimum: Sufficient oil to fully recharge the system

In general, when ordering lubricating oil stocks, normal volumes above minimum supply should be for 3-4 months duration or per round voyage. If in doubt, discuss this with the technical superintendent.

Bulk oil supplies are normally available only for cylinder oil, main engine system and aux. engines oil. There is a minimum bulk oil supply quantity for which bulk supply discount applies. This quantity varies for different grades, ports and oil companies. Discuss the minimum bulk quantity applicable in each case with the technical superintendent and consider when ordering lubricating oils.

Where possible, lift lube oils at price preferential ports only.

Submit requirements for other grades of lubricants - non-bulk, to the technical department at the same time as requirements for bulk oils.

###### Storage and Handling of Lubricating Oils & Lubricants

- Mark lubricating oil storage tanks clearly with the grade of oil it contains

- When lubricating oil for topping up a system is taken from a drum that has been stored on deck or in a compartment, take care to retain the cleanliness of this topping up oil

- Close sounding pipes to avoid ingress of dust and foreign particles as well as for safety

Caution!	Do not secure weighted lever cocks in the open position.

- Run lubricating oil purifier with the minimum throughput, correct temperature and largest gravity disc (to ensure the maximum separation of water) and with the sludge discharge cycle adjusted to remove the sludge as it builds up

- Run the main engine and auxiliary engine purifiers continuously, except for periods of maintenance. For auxiliary engines where one purifier is normally shared between engines, purify one engine at a time.

- Follow good practices such as:

- Maintain temperature as high as practicable and as per the purifier and engine makers recommendations. Where possible this should be 90+ oC for trunk engines and slightly lower for cross head engines

- Where possible, operate the purifier on a running engine

- Carry out batch purification or renewal of auxiliary engine oils periodically according to the oil condition and PMS requirements

Clean or change lubricating oil filters as per the machinery manufacturer's instructions.

Note1:	 In case of UMS operations, switch the purifier to a non-running engine

Note2:	For auxiliary engines the purification time should be proportional to the engine running time

Note3:	Reduce the purifier sludging intervals when the piston rod stuffing box or L.O filter drain tank is put through the L.O. purifier

##### Managing Voyage Repairs

###### Introduction

On-board repairs ensure that all equipment, critical and non-critical, is maintained in operational condition. Inform the chief engineer of the nature of any breakdown that occurs so that he can decide on how to rectify the fault soonest using best maintenance practice.

Under normal circumstances, rectify any defects found, whether through routine operation, tests, checks or breakdown soonest and enter the details of any work carried out in the PMS.

Despite having a robust maintenance policy, on occasions failures or breakdowns may occur. These failures might be repairable by ship’s staff or might require shore assistance.

###### Responsibilities

The master, chief engineer and chief officer shall manage all defects as soon as discovered or reported to shipboard management.

The chief engineer shall ensure that the vessel carries, as a minimum, the spare parts as indicated in the relevant manufacturers’ instruction manuals or the vessel’s spares inventory for critical equipment.

Supervise the shore workers and riding crew effectively to ensure both productivity and safety.

###### Managing Voyage Repairs Guidance

- Inform the office immediately if unable to rectify any defects by ship’s staff. Submit a detailed report to ship’s superintendent.

- If it is deemed proper to carry out the work at the next scheduled repair period, submit a dry dock repair specification. In case an opportunity arises to complete the repair before the planned dry docking or repair period then cancel this specification at that stage.

Note:	Superintendent in charge will arrange for an earlier repair, if warranted, either in port, during the voyage or in case an earlier period of downtime is required. Depending on the scale of repair, the risk involved and any down time required the decision to proceed will be made in consultation with the technical and general manager.

###### Risk Assessment

- Conduct a risk assessment prior to commencing any on-board repairs

- Prepare extensive assessment of the risks for repairs of critical systems and of more significant pieces of equipment, to avoid any personal injuries or damage to the equipment and to assess any consequences

- Seek approval from appropriate levels of shore management before commencement

###### Reports

Use normal reporting format, including appropriate company forms and the planned maintenance system (record all details) in case of machinery overhauls or repairs.

Update the shore management of progress and completion on a daily (or otherwise agreed) basis.

###### Training-Safety-Familiarization

Before beginning any repair, work involving a riding squad, hold a meeting, involving the shipboard management team and the riding squad to cover the following subjects:

- Lifeboat and emergency stations, identification of emergency signals, smoking regulations and personal protective equipment

- If working in the engine room, operate UMS only after all work is completed and the vicinity inspected to ensure safety for UMS operation

- The requirements and procedures involved in permits for hot work, entry into enclosed spaces, isolation of equipment/pipelines and codes of safe working practices relating to the work in hand

- Details of the work to be carried out and ships staff involvement

- Verify working hours e.g. what is “normal time” and what is “overtime”

###### Completion of the Work

When work is completed, the ships staff, work squad, the chief officer or chief engineer shall “walk through” the job and ensure that systems are correctly restored.

Close out the permit to work when the above is done.

###### Reference / Records / Forms

It is appreciated that most of the following records are filed within in the PMS and shipboard filing system. It may be beneficial to make additional photocopies of records and file them together with the photos. 
File copies of the following:

- Risk assessment

- Minutes of meeting / agenda

- Permit to work + company's forms for enclosed spaces, atmosphere testing

- Copies of drawings and diagrams used

- Copies of time logs and work sheets

### 10.1.5 Difficult Conditions - rev 0 issued 13.12.2024

##### Slow and Super Slow Steaming

###### Introduction

The charter party may require the vessel to perform the voyage at Slow or Super Slow Steaming to increase efficiency and minimize transportation costs.

The main engine is typically designed for continuous operation between about 20% to 90% MCR or “NCR” as indicated by the maker. The behavior of the main engine is also linked to other auxiliary machinery.

This procedure provides guidance on safety aspects, procedures, general precautions, and management of engine room (E/R) activities when the vessel is ordered to proceed at Slow Steaming (SS) or Super Slow Steaming (SSS).

###### Responsibilities

Master and Chief Engineer shall consider all aspects related to the safe operation of the ship and management of vessel’s equipment when proceeding at SS or SSS.

###### Safety Considerations and Procedures

When ordered to proceed at SS or SSS speeds, conduct a risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks. Risks associated with SS or SSS:

- Insufficient rest for personnel or violation of rest hours requirements.

- Hazards associated with running engines outside the manufacturer's recommendations.

- Hazards associated with operating auxiliary equipment not typically in use.

- Hazards related to revised inspection/maintenance schedules.

- Insufficient monitoring of main engine and other equipment parameters.

- Navigational hazards (confined waters, heavy traffic, weather, environmental conditions).

Operating at Reduced RPM:

- Ensure no sudden load changes due to course alterations or weather changes.

- If auxiliary blowers operate intermittently, implement these procedures:

- Put auxiliary blowers in manual mode to avoid damage from repeated starts.

- Continuously man the engine room and revise working arrangements accordingly.

- Operate an additional auxiliary engine.

- Inform the master and OOW of current E/R operating conditions and limitations.

Minimum Load Considerations:

- Never operate the main engine at loads less than 10% of the MCR.

- Seek confirmation from the technical department for minimum allowed M/E load if instructed to proceed at minimum load.

- Consider effects of following currents and environmental conditions to maintain loads above 10% MCR.

###### Common Concerns Related to Slow Steaming

During slow steaming, follow additional routines and inspections as the main engine operates outside its optimal range. Concerns include:

- Frequent and thorough scavenge and under piston inspections.

- Adjust cylinder lubrication rate to optimal value; over lubrication is as dangerous as under lubrication.

- Fouling of turbochargers and loss of efficiency due to reduced air flow and deposit build-up.

- Increased carbon deposits on injectors, compromising performance.

- Fouling of exhaust gas economizer, reducing capacity and increasing soot fire risk.

- Reduced scavenge air pressure, leading to improper combustion.

- Improper atomization of fuel and impingement.

- Increased carbon deposits, requiring modified maintenance intervals.

- Low exhaust gas temperatures can cause low-temperature corrosion (below 250 ºC).

- Reduced peak compression pressure.

- Potential damage when running at full load after prolonged slow steaming.

- Compromised piston ring pack efficiency, leading to increased deposits.

- Increased risk of scavenge fires, necessitating extra drainage of scavenge and under piston areas.

- Loss of heat transfer due to carbon deposits and thermal stress-induced component failure.

- Reduced economizer efficiency, necessitating oil-fired boiler operation, adding extra cost and maintenance.

###### Checks for Slow Steaming

Traditional marine engines (except intelligent engines) operating in low load mode require several checks:

- Frequent scavenge and under piston area inspections.

- Inspecting piston rings for breakage, fouling, and lack of springiness.

- Frequent exhaust boiler inspection and cleaning (consider using high-pressure jet machines).

- Checking cylinder lubrication rate; inspect liners and pistons for over and under lubrication and scuffing.

- Monitoring turbocharger RPM and scavenge air pressure; drops may indicate fouling.

- Recording exhaust gas temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the turbocharger; reductions may indicate turbine fouling.

- Monitoring funnel stack temperature after the exhaust gas boiler; gradual increases in temperature and decreases in steam pressure may indicate fouling, while sudden increases may suggest a minor fire.

- Taking frequent indicator cards to check main engine performance.

- Frequent drainage of air cooler water.

###### Precautions and Maintenance for Slow Steaming

Breakdowns during slow steaming typically occur when the engine resumes normal operation. To prevent breakdowns, follow these precautions and maintenance routines:

- Dry washing of the turbine wheel and compressor washing during load-up.

- Frequent soot blowing of the EGB.

- Avoid water condensation in air coolers; maintain scavenge air temperature around 40-45 ºC.

- Maintain hot well temperature via condenser cooling water control and direct condensate bypass to the hot well.

- Use the correct cylinder oil feed rate as recommended by the manufacturer, after consulting the ship’s technical superintendent.

- Use higher BN cylinder oil as recommended by the manufacturer.

- Maintain fuel injectors properly; consider revised maintenance intervals due to increased fouling and dripping during slow steaming.

- Prevent low exhaust temperatures to avoid cold corrosion; keep exhaust temperature after the cylinder above 250 ºC (note: this temperature is crucial as it will drop further after heat extraction in the exhaust boiler).

- Frequent washing of the exhaust gas boiler and additional soot blowing routines.

- Main injection viscosity of fuel oil should be between 12 to 13 CST.

- Maintain higher LT temperature in central cooling plants for optimal scavenge temperature and jacket cooling water temperature.

- Bypass freshwater generator if necessary to maintain jacket temperature.

- Keep the auxiliary blower continuously on in manual mode to prevent elevated exhaust temperatures after cut-off and before the cut-in period (exhaust temperatures above 450 ºC can cause hot corrosion and exhaust valve burning).

- Frequent inspections of the exhaust manifold; low load operation can cause unburnt fuel and cylinder oil accumulation, potentially leading to sudden burning and turbocharger over-speeding when the load increases.

##### Fresh Water Generator

###### Introduction

The on-board freshwater generation system improves the overall efficiency of the main engine plant and saves on the expenditure of purchasing fresh water in ports where it is often very expensive.

Therefore, it is important that fresh water is made whenever possible and the plant is kept well maintained.

###### Responsibilities

Chief Engineer: Responsible for the efficient operation of the on-board fresh water generation system.

Chief Officer: Responsible for the management of fresh water on board.

###### Maintaining Fresh Water Generator Guidance

- Before commencing making fresh water, the duty engineer should check with the officer of the watch to ensure the vessel is clear of polluted waters.

- Always use the freshwater generator pre-treatment to prevent scaling and thereby maintain the rated output. This treatment should be fed to the freshwater generator using the dosing tank and flow meter.

- Post-treatment of generated water is always required to disinfect, neutralize, and add hardness salts to give a better taste. Untreated water is more corrosive to pipe systems and less beneficial to the human digestive tract.

- Regular cleaning and maintenance should be carried out per the manufacturer's instructions to ensure that the complete generation system functions effectively.

- After using chemicals during maintenance or cleaning (e.g., de-scaling), thoroughly flush the system. It is recommended that the initial water produced be wasted to sea.

- To monitor the performance of the generator, enter the daily running hours and quantity of fresh water produced per day in the freshwater evaporator log at noon.

###### Reference / Records / Forms

- Fresh water evaporator log

##### Ventilation

### 10.1.9 Dry Docking - rev 0 issued 13.12.2024

##### Voyage Repairs

###### Introduction

A voyage repair is any repair to the ship or its equipment, other than those undertaken as part of a scheduled major repair period, carried out by an outside contractor.

The master and Chief Engineer (C/E) shall make early and adequate arrangements for any voyage repairs.

Whenever repair personnel, tools, and significant or bulky spares are required, inform the superintendent to promptly secure these resources and arrange with local agents at the ports of call.

###### Riding Teams

When necessary, the company may embark additional crew members, riding teams, or competent service engineers.

The company shall ensure that maintenance, inspections, or repair works performed by these teams adhere to the management system’s policies and procedures.

When a “riding team” (contractors, supernumeraries, etc.) boards the ship, they are subject to the ship’s normal disciplinary requirements and must be advised of the company’s policies and safety standards (work permit system, PPE requirements, etc…)

Their foreman shall be responsible to the master and the C/E for the team's behavior and performance.

Before the vessel sails, conduct a meeting to familiarize them with the company’s policies and safety procedures, consulting and completing form ADM 22 “Familiarization for contractors” as necessary. Always supervise their duties adequately.

Employ these personnel only for the range of duties specified in their agreement. If the agreement permits a wider scope, the master or the C/E must establish the personnel's competence for any specific task or duty before allocating work. If in doubt, seek the company’s advice before assigning non-specified work.

Do not leave riding teams to work independently for long periods. A senior officer, nominated by the master or the C/E, should attend and verify compliance with safety and environmental protection procedures.

Ensure the team receives adequate rest and necessary work permits.

###### Monitoring of Subcontractors' Performance

Repairs should be carried out by the manufacturer's authorized service personnel or a company-approved contractor.

If this is not possible, the company shall arrange for the best alternative contractor.

In an emergency, the master may use whatever resources are available.

The company monitors contractors and riding squads to ensure they provide a high standard of service and perform to company standards.

When company superintendents cannot attend, the Chief Officer (C/O) or C/E will coordinate, control, monitor, and evaluate the contractors' work.

The master will allocate this responsibility after consulting with the technical superintendent, who will instruct the master and the contractors.

The responsible officer must keep detailed records and compile a daily report for the technical manager.

The master and the C/E shall coordinate and inspect the repairs, requesting acceptance tests where necessary to verify compliance with applicable standards.

If the ship’s superintendent is present, he will assume the above responsibilities.

Comments on contractors’ performance are passed to the technical manager and recorded on the approved list of suppliers, with no comment if service is satisfactory and comments made if service is found deficient.

##### Dry-Docking

###### Introduction

This guidance covers preparation before, during, and after dry-docking.

A vessel typically dry-docks at intervals of five years, but ship staff should be prepared for emergency underwater repairs at any time.

Note: vessels over 15 years old shall drydock twice in 5 years, i.e. at Special and Intermediary Surveys. The Intermediary Survey should occur not more than 36 months from the Special Survey.

For vessels under 15 years old, the drydocking for Intermediary Survey can be replaced by an in-water survey.

Dry-docking is the primary opportunity for underwater hull maintenance to keep the vessel functioning efficiently until the next scheduled repair.

###### Responsibilities

Master:

- Ensure the safety of the vessel, crew, and environment while in dry-dock.

- Delegate the Officer of the Watch (OOW) to oversee safe operations in the dry-dock.

- Maintain required stability and trim for dry-docking.

- Ensure tank conditions are maintained for re-floating as when the vessel entered dry-dock.

Chief Engineer and Chief Officer: Prepare a repair list for items outside normal dry-dock specifications.

Chief Officer:

- Personally witness the removal and replacement of bottom plugs and take custody of them.

- Ensures the stability of the vessel during all drydock stages, i.e. including entering and leaving the Drydock

OOW: Oversee safe operations of all activities in the dry-dock. Inform the master of any safety concerns.

##### Dry-Docking Guidance

###### Preparing the Dry-Dock Repair List

- Regularly submit job repair lists to the technical superintendent using form ENG 23 'Dry-dock repair form'.

- Ensure all work scope items are covered to avoid additional "extra" costs charged by the shipyard.

- Include full equipment details, safety, staging, cleaning for hot work, access removals/replacement, drawing numbers, sketches, touch-up coatings, and whether spares are supplied by owners or yard.

###### During the Voyage to Dry-Dock

- The technical superintendent finalizes specifications and sends them to the vessel for onboard job identification/marking and clarifications.

- The master and chief engineer shall hold a pre-dry-dock meeting to familiarize officers and petty officers with the repair scope.

- Crew members assigned to jobs must fully understand the work scope and their duties.

- Pre-mark jobs to allow repair yard workers to start immediately upon arrival. Use paint sticks for markings.

- Protect accommodation areas with strong plastic sheeting.

- Implement a security and safety plan due to increased personnel onboard.

- Clean and gas-free tanks scheduled for survey/inspection and hot work. Liaise with the technical department for the tank cleaning plan.

- Plan sludge and sediment removal from oil tanks.

- Ensure the required draft and trim for entering dry-dock are met on arrival.

- Ship’s staff must not carry out hot work unless approved by the shipyard. Complete necessary 'Hot work permit' and 'enclosed space entry certificate'.

- The master should draw up a safety checklist and ensure all onboard are aware of precautions.

- Assign officers to track special equipment, tools, and drawings used by the shipyard.

###### Preparation for Entering the Dock

Supervision and Control: The master, company superintendent, or appointed person must maintain full control of the dry-dock, ensuring safety and proper conduct of work. Specific procedures are required when the ship is in a ‘dead ship’ condition or has limited electrical power.

Before Entry:

- Coordinate with local port authorities and harbor master for requirements before dry-dock entry.

- Ensure responsibilities, duty rosters, and contingency plans are in place.

- Check the vessel's stability, condition to meet specified draughts, keep the vessel upright, prepare and stow mooring lines, and stand by for dock master and mooring gang.

- Display required flags and signals.

- Minimize free surface effects and secure movable weights.

- Prepare ship power, fire main, fresh water, telephone connections.

- Switch off and retract logs and echo sounder.

- Shut overboard discharges and secure gangway/accommodation ladders and anchors.

- Crew to assist moorings as needed.

Standing Orders During Dry-Dock:

- Methods of raising alarms, fire patrol frequency, means of escape, information on firefighting appliances, contingency plans, shore emergency contact numbers, monitoring, and record-keeping.

- Provision of portable extinguishers if ship’s equipment is removed for servicing.

- Use of shipboard or shore sanitary facilities.

While Entering: Record times of vessel entering dock, caisson gate closing, pumping out commencement, vessel touching blocks, and pump out completion in the logbook.

After Docking:

- Check and record tank and bilge soundings, hand over copies to dock master.

- Hull high-pressure wash as the water level goes down.

- Initial hull inspection for damage, rudder and propeller damage, shoring arrangements, and keel blocks.

- Remove bottom plugs in the presence of the C/O, who retains custody.

- Shut down bridge equipment including gyro and record the heading.

###### Requirements for Dry Docking

Stability is the most important requirement for getting a ship safely into a dry dock. The three important parameters that must be ensured before entering the dry dock are:

- Adequate Initial G.M:

- When the ship touches the blocks, there is a reaction at the point of contact that raises the center of gravity "G" and reduces the metacentric height "G.M." Therefore, adequate initial metacentric height is required to compensate for this change.

- Vessel to be Upright:

- While entering the dock, the vessel needs to be upright. If the ship touches the blocks outside the centerline, it may tip over.

- Small or Moderate Trim Aft:

- A slight trim allows the stern and bow to rest in tandem rather than simultaneously, reducing the load and pressure on the hull and keel of the vessel.

####### Stability Considerations

- As the waterline moves down, the center of buoyancy moves down.

- As buoyancy moves down, the ship's metacenter moves up.

- As the ship's keel rests on the blocks, gravity moves up.

Since the centre of gravity rises faster than the metacentre, the two points will eventually align, resulting in neutral stability where no righting arms are produced. The draft where GM = 0 is called the ship's critical draft. Calculating the ship's critical draft is crucial. Dewatering of the dock stops just before the critical draft is reached to verify the ship is properly supported by the side blocks. When aground, knowing the range of tide will determine if the ship might reach its critical draft.

####### Critical Period

The critical period is the time from when the keel first touches the blocks and starts to be 'sewn' on blocks. Upthrust, denoted by "P," caused by the blocks, reduces GM as both G moves up and M moves down to M'.

Formulas for calculations:

- P = TPC x Change in mean draft in cm.

- P = MCTC x t / l {t = trim in cm, l = distance of CF from AP}

Shift calculations:

- GG' = (P x KG) / (W - P)

- MM' = (P x KM) / W

Negative GM is dangerous and must be avoided as it can cause the vessel to lose positive stability, capsize, or slip off the blocks. Calculate the maximum loss of GM beforehand.

Office Review of Stress & Stability Calculations

Before entering the dock, calculate stability and stress for the docking phases and submit relevant loadicator printouts to the office for review. The office may provide remarks and recommendations if necessary.

###### Entering the Yard

- The chief engineer and electrical engineer must supervise the connection and transfer to shore power.

- Ensure overboard discharges are shut/blanked-off as required.

- Vessels with fixed CO2 systems must blank off the main outlet pipes to the protected spaces at the start of repairs and display a sign in the ship’s office stating that the system is isolated. Remove the blanks at the end of the repair period before the vessel starts the voyage. The chief engineer is responsible for isolating the CO2 system.

- Monitor the vessel's stability during the critical period.

- Begin initial bottom inspection when the dry-dock is empty.

The master should address the following points and agree on their execution with the dockyard:

- Identify the coordinator at the yard and direct all formalities through them.

- Obtain contact details of the port facility security officer and ISPS requirements.

- Clarify responsibilities between the vessel and the yard as early as possible.

- Instruct the yard about the vessel’s fire protection system and provide a copy of the fire plan.

- Conduct a meeting with dry-dock management to discuss the scope of work, safety regulations, and establish clear communication lines before commencing any work.

- Ensure required certificates and permissions are obtained before starting any job, whether performed by yard staff, vessel’s crew, or contractors.

- Arrange adequate lighting for escape routes from the engine area or other difficult-to-evacuate areas.

- Recharge portable fire extinguishers, CO2 cylinders, and similar equipment on board whenever possible.

- Connect the vessel’s fire mains to the shore water supply and maintain necessary pressure on hydrants.

- Maintain a 24-hour fire watch throughout the vessel by a crew member.

- Always ensure safe and well-illuminated access to and from the vessel.

- Provide the yard with a detailed list of all tank soundings/tonnages and a copy of the vessel’s stability condition.

- Distribute copies of the repair list to officers and ensure they are familiar with the work to be done.

- Coordinate any necessary ballasting and de-ballasting with the dock manager, particularly when the vessel is in a floating dock.

- Insist on daily progress meetings attended by the vessel’s superintendent and shipyard representatives. These should be held at the beginning and end of each day. The yard must supply a bar chart at the start of repairs showing the intended progress for critical job items. Display this in the ship’s office and update it regularly to ensure all major items are on track and completed by the end of the contracted repair time.

- The chief officer must present a list of plugs to be removed to the dry-dock manager, personally witness their removal, take custody of the removed plugs, ensure each one is labeled, and witness their replacement.

###### During Vessel’s Stay in the Yard

Participation in Daily Safety/Work Meetings with the Yard

Every morning, hold a safety/work plan meeting with the vessel’s officers, superintendent, ship repair manager, and his foremen. Discuss items such as:

- The spaces where work will start or is in progress, precautions to be taken, and preparation and signing of relevant permits. Review all permits in effect and all permits issued or canceled since the last meeting.

- Coordinate all work by the yard, contractor, and ship personnel to avoid changes that could jeopardize the ship or workers.

- Identify locations for blasting or chemical cleaning, review the MSDS of the chemicals used, and ensure adequate precautions.

- Identify any pipelines to be dismantled, valves to be opened or closed, and test results of the atmosphere within pipelines to verify safety.

- Verify that opening lines or valves will not result in fluid flow into areas compromising safety or health.

- Review all system or equipment tests and coordinate these with other repair activities.

- Review all ultrasonic, X-ray, or hydrostatic testing planned for the day and ensure safety precautions are in place.

- Confirm any changes in the location of all liquids on board, including ballast and bunkers.

- Review possible additional work or alterations to existing plans.

- Review any incidents causing injury to workers or ship staff or damage to the ship. Identify the cause and actions to prevent recurrence.

- Review reports of deviations from safety norms and procedures, identify corrective actions, and establish a timetable for completion.

Before the meeting, carry out a joint ship and shipyard personnel round of work locations onboard and ashore to assess actual work progress.

The ship’s officers shall immediately inspect, and test all completed works before acceptance. Upon completion of work, inspect ballast and cargo tanks with the vessel's and dry dock representatives to ensure they are free of lost objects, garbage, or other items. The OOW shall record the identity of the responsible vessel representative.

Assigned ship’s officers shall monitor the progress of all works to ensure high standards and no forgotten items. The attending superintendent shall report work progress regularly to the office.

Review security and safety requirements daily and provide additional hands for fire patrols where necessary. Maintain a complete record of work performed and hours worked by shipyard staff.

Frequently check the bottom and monitor cleaning, grit blasting, and painting. Ensure the agreed size of grit is used, the area is blasted to industry standards, cleaned, and painted under ideal weather conditions.

Plan visits to workshops to inspect equipment being repaired or steel fabrications. Encourage junior staff to attend these inspections with senior officers for job experience.

Liaise with class for surveys and inspections to clear all statutory renewals and due survey items.

A ship’s officer shall inspect all tanks and void spaces opened for inspection to ensure cleanliness and no leftover tools, rags, or other remnants of the repair. Pay particular attention to the amount and size of any scaffolding or fencing installed by the shipyard and maintain a detailed record of it by the OOW.

###### Prior to Leaving the Dry-Dock

Shipboard management, together with the attending technical superintendent, shall develop a re-commissioning plan at the end of an extended repair period (or any extended shutdown). This plan can be developed in any appropriate format, as the depth and detail will vary according to the extent of the repairs.

If any ballast tanks have been emptied after entering dry-dock, start refilling them in good time to complete before flooding and re-floating. Test all manhole covers and other openings that were opened during repairs for watertightness.

The chief officer must confirm that the weight distribution is the same as the arrival condition in dry-dock. Check the stability and ensure the vessel remains upright when re-floating.

Before flooding the dry-dock, the master, chief engineer, and chief officer should inspect the dock bottom with a responsible representative of the yard to confirm that all bottom plugs removed for draining tanks have been refitted and all sea suctions have been correctly re-assembled. Make an entry to this effect in the deck logbook.

Check that the rudder and propeller are clear, and the rope guard is in place. Ensure the bow thruster opening is clear and anchors and chains are secured on board. Remove all rubbish, old/damaged steelworks, and fittings from the vessel, and discharge any garbage skips ashore.

The crew should be alert during the re-flooding of the dock and re-floating of the vessel to handle any unexpected problems. Once the vessel has re-floated, take a complete set of soundings to identify any unexpected results. Conduct a thorough examination as soon as the sea valves and sea chests are submerged, re-check them once the dock is filled, and before leaving the dock.

If water ingress is noted at any stage of re-floating, stop the operation and repair the leak. Sometimes, consider pumping out the dock again to allow for leak rectification.

Check that the floating drafts correspond to the calculated drafts and investigate any discrepancies. Monitor the operation of any overhauled equipment.

Before starting the main engine, after any extended shutdown and particularly at the end of a dry docking, warm it through as per the maker's instructions. Operate the lube oil purifier and carry out a final inspection of the crankcase. A further crankcase inspection must be completed after a short period of operation.

Before departure from the shipyard, draw a full set of lube samples and send them for analysis ashore. Additionally, carry out an onboard analysis of all samples.

When leaving dry-dock:

- Ensure bottom plugs are put back in place in the presence of the C/O.

- Inspect the hull and dock with the master, C/O, and C/E.

- Check and record tanks and bilge soundings throughout the vessel, and hand over a copy of tank soundings to the dock master.

- Hand over a copy of the vessel’s condition to the dock master.

- Prepare the crew for un-docking stations.

- Record the following times in the logbook:

- Time of dock floor and hull inspection by senior officers.

- Time flooding of the dock started.

- Time the water level reached sea chests and stopped for inspection.

- Time flooding of the dock resumed.

- Time vessel lifted off blocks.

- Time caisson gate opened.

- Time vessel cleared the dry-dock.

Complete form ENG 21 “Leaving Dry Dock Checklist” and hand it over to the office representative prior to departure from the port.

###### Implementation of Work / Rest Restrictions Whilst in the Yard

Prior to the vessel's return to normal operation after the completion of the dry dock, the master shall ensure that all officers and crew have received adequate rest, in accordance with international and company procedures, and are fully capable of assuming their duties. During the dry-docking period, crew work/rest hours shall comply with applicable requirements and be documented as per company procedures.

###### Re-commissioning of Equipment Prior to Leaving the Yard

The quality of the work performed, seaworthiness, and safety is finally verified by the Class Society/Flag state surveyor, who will issue appropriate certificates.

The master shall ensure that all correct certificates and endorsements are onboard prior to sailing and send copies of all new certificates or endorsements to the office.

Upon completion of sea trials, the superintendent, master, and all department heads must review the ship's performance and the operation of the machinery. Any abnormalities noticed should be rectified to the satisfaction of the superintendent and master before the vessel's departure.

All checks as per the office checklist TECH-22 should be completed, and a notice about the satisfactory completion of all shipboard equipment re-commissioning should be entered in the deck logbook.

Prior to departure from the yard, the master should send the completed office checklist TECH-22 to the office and confirm via email the vessel’s return to normal operation, with all equipment adequately re-commissioned and with full operational integrity.

###### Yard Evaluation upon Completion of the Repairs

Upon completion of the dry docking, the superintendent, with the assistance of the vessel’s senior officers, shall complete the office form TECH 23 “Shipyard Evaluation Form” to report on the shipyard's dry dock performance regarding the quality and effectiveness of the works, efficiency, safety, and security procedures, etc.

## 10.2 Planned Maintenance System



### 10.2.1 PMS - rev 0 issued 13.12.2024

##### Planned Maintenance System (PMS)

###### Introduction

The ISM Code requires company vessels to have a formal maintenance and defect report system and optimum spare parts inventories.

The company considers that the planned maintenance procedures are essential and obligatory to operate at the REEDEREI NORD requested level of reliability and to avoid unnecessary downtime or expensive incidents.

The company's standards ensure:

- The structural integrity of all vessels is maintained

- An appropriate maintenance standard and monitoring program is used

- Relevant vessel certification remains valid, and an appropriate monitoring system is in force. The system is set up to include maintenance and testing deadlines set by management, makers, and Class and is as per industry standards.

- The availability of approved or suitable spares, materials and all resources necessary to carry out Maintenance

- Controlling the stocking of spare parts and materials

- The testing and process of Maintenance and any overdue items are monitored both on board and from the shore

- A system for tracing components that can be reused in different positions (circulating components, e.g. piston, cylinder cover) shall be established for all machinery and equipment covered by the Class

- The PMS databases for a newly acquired vessel may need a reasonable time for population and activation. Until this process is completed to the technical manager's satisfaction, the vessel may be temporarily operated using paper-based PMS and relevant reporting forms based on the company's established PMS routines.

###### Responsibilities

The Chief Engineer

- Is in charge of the PMS on board, and the IT department and PMS administrator ashore shall ensure it functions correctly.

- Is in charge of the machinery alarm management system. The Chief Engineer shall be responsible for any change in the alarm settings (off-scan or scan).

- Documents the planning of maintenance activities; maintains and reports these activities in the system.

- Ensures all records for maintenance, repair, inspection and test activities are recorded

- Ensures that the onboard planned maintenance records are kept up to date.

- Ensures that all deck machinery and engine room equipment are maintained as per PMS and Maker's manuals.

- Inspects and assesses the technical condition of all deck machinery and engine room equipment as per PMS.

- Ensures that officers and crew are familiar with the requirements of the PMS. If necessary, provide them with specific training.

- Ensures that all overdue PMS items are attended to immediately and notifies the TSI.

- Notifies TSI if there is a need to modify the vessel PMS.

The Chief Officer

- Assist the chief engineer with the deck equipment maintenance.

- Perform the mooring equipment brake test, and maintains test records.

- Inspect and assess the technical condition of all deck equipment, such as cranes, mooring winches, anchoring windlasses, etc., before use.

- Inspect and maintain all the ropes, wires, and lifting gear on deck as per PMS.

Note: The Chief Officer shall seek the advice of the Chief Engineer for technical matters.

###### Maintenance Reliability & Sustainability

Downtime / Root Cause for Incidents

###### PMS Update Guidance

The PMS identifies when planned jobs become due.

The system is requested to generate a job list of all work due within an indicated timeframe.

Maintenance intervals are hours or calendar-based, depending on the manufacturer's recommendations and managers' experience.

Update the system each month with equipment hour-meter readings

The interval for Maintenance can be changed if experience indicates this is necessary. Documents should be reviewed before extending such intervals

All officers shall maintain their particular areas of responsibility up-to-date within the system as per job description

###### Job Reports

PMS records and reports are available both onboard and for the management office ashore.

The PMS includes procedures for monitoring condition reports, which provide an overview of the state of specific shipboard equipment.

The principle of the system is that those carrying out the work complete the work done reports, or the officer in charge of the work does this.

It is accepted and understood that items in the system based on the calendar rather than hours might not require overhaul at the specified interval. In such cases, the job may be postponed subject to approval from the technical department.

Alternatively, revising the specified interval may be considered and approved if appropriate.

Follow the below procedure to ensure that there is consistency and accuracy in reporting:

- The chief engineer/chief officer shall review the reports the engine room/deck staff submitted before verifying and exporting them to the office.

Note:	This proves he/she is aware of and controls the whole process.

- The chief engineer/chief officer edit the reports or request more information from the responsible person.

- Once reviewed, the report will be appended "Reviewed by C/E"/"Reviewed by C/OFF" with Initials or name added.

##### Corrective Maintenance

Corrective Maintenance is any damages/breakdowns on equipment outside of planned Maintenance for equipment existing in PMS that are immediately repaired on board using existing spares and resources, i.e. the repairs and records are made without affecting planned maintenance interval ( next due date).

The PMS software also provides a way to report Corrective Maintenance. Refer to the instructions in the PMS manual and the highlights sent to the vessel.

###### Corrective Maintenance Reporting Guidance

The Chief Engineer/ Chief Officer shall follow these guidelines.

- The vessel records the corrective job.

Note: For corrective jobs, inform the technical superintendent in charge of the vessel. For Critical equipment, follow the defect procedure.

- The vessel should include the list of the corrective jobs in the weekly reports for the past week only.

- The vessel should send the office a list of corrective jobs with monthly returns.

Note:	The above process requires ship or office staff to communicate through other channels to ensure all are aware of the Defect and the measures to resolve it (including near-miss reporting, accident reports, and typical day-to-day communications as appropriate).

##### Recommendations (One Time Jobs)

Recommendations (One Time Jobs) are advice and/or instructions made to the vessel to ensure compliance with the organisation's goals, bylaws, regulations, rules, and any other imprtant works.

This option allows the technical superintendent to create recommendations for any jobs that are performed on a vessel and monitor completion and follow-up.

###### Recommendations (One Time Jobs) Creation Guidance

The Chief Engineer shall follow these guidelines.

- The office creates recommendations (One Time Job) and informs the vessel. (The recommendation ( One Time Job) is initiated from the office)

    - Note: When creating recommendations (One Time Job), ensure that the title mentions which rule, regulation, and bylaw this recommendation refers to - e.g. ISM 15.01 PMS Rev 5 Issued 10.12.2018

- Vessel receives and reviews recommendation

- The vessel completes the recommendation and closes it.

- The vessel should send a weekly report of open recommendations to the technical superintendent.

Note:	Vessel /Office shall enter all required data and attach all documents that should aid in closing/completing the recommendation (One Time Job) together with objective evidence of closing said recommendation (One Time Job).

Note:	The above process requires ship or office staff to communicate through other channels to ensure all are aware of the Defect and the measures to resolve it (including near-miss reporting, accident reports, and normal day-to-day communications as appropriate).

##### Repairs

During the voyage, unavoidable circumstances lead to the wear and tear of the equipment and machinery.

To ensure the vessel's safety, immediate repair work must be done for the damaged equipment. This option will be used when a third party is involved in the repairs.

###### Repairs Creation Guidance

The Chief Engineer/Officer shall follow these guidelines

- Vessel informs the office, agrees with the office about opening repairs in the system

- Vessel creates an entry for the repair works by giving all the required details

- Vessel requisition after filling up repairs.

- Vessel updates the office.

- Office – upon receiving repair, the office reviews, puts comments and attaches applicable reports.

- Vessel – upon completing repairs, changes status to Closed

Note:	The above process requires ship or office staff to communicate through other channels to ensure all are aware of the repairs and the measures to resolve the same (including near-miss reporting, accident reports and normal day-to-day communications as appropriate).

##### Defect

A defect is a failure in, or in the operation of, a part of the ship's structure or its machinery, equipment or fittings that can not be rectified with existing resources on board and could adversely impact the safety, Environmental, and reliability of the vessel.

In addition, the following shall also be considered defects:

- Any Class observations, such as Conditions of Class, Conditions of Authority and Memoranda

- A coating system damage inside cargo or ballast tanks, other double hull spaces, or on the hull shows evidence of deep pitting or wastage, which could lead to structural deterioration if not rectified.

- Critical equipment breakdown and malfunction  that cannot be rectified on board with existing resources

- A defect shall be reported in the PMS software under the "Defect" reporting module.

Note: The vessel should immediately start a preliminary investigation and communicate the immediate/root causes to the TSI and any evidence supporting the findings. The TSI shall decide if further investigation is necessary.

The final investigation results shall be recorded in the "Defect" reporting option in the software and include any supporting documentation.

Note: Management shall decide if a separate "Investigation Report - Lessons Learned" for the failure is required.

###### Classification of defects

A defect shall be classified based on the consequences' criticality and/or severity.

Follow the below guidance:

Note: after the initial notification, the TSI shall assign the severity rating for the Defect and notify the required stakeholders.

###### Defect Reporting Guidance

The chief engineer shall follow these guidelines.

- Vessel creates defects and informs the office. (The Defect can only be proposed from the vessel.)

Note: Choose the Risk level from the drop-down menu when creating a defect.

- If identified as high risk, prepare a temporary MoC; mention this in "Description" and attach all documentation ( e.g. 1st Email, RA, MOC, Manual, Drawings, pictures, photos, proposed solution, RO, link to NM or Incident Accidtent Investigation, etc.)

###### Replacement of Recovery Wires of Free-Fall Lifeboats

Renew free-fall lifeboat recovery wires and slings 30 months or earlier if they have deteriorated.

Do not protect securing sling wires with any vinyl or plastic sheathing.

Note: This may impede regular inspection and greasing.

###### Life-Saving Equipment Maintenance and Weekly/Monthly Inspections

Carry out the following tests and inspections weekly and enter a report of the inspection in the PMS and deck logbook:

- Inspect survival crafts, rescue boats, and launching appliances to ensure they are ready for use. The inspection shall include at least:

- The condition of hooks and their attachment to the lifeboat.

- The on-load release gear being properly and completely reset.

Note: Normally, the on-load release gear is verified during the 3M boat exercise. Review the manufacturer’s instructions for any additional requirements for the inspection of the gear using the lifeboat “hang off” procedure (if required).

- Operation of engines in lifeboats and rescue boats for a total period of not less than 3 minutes, provided the ambient temperature is above the minimum required for starting and running the engine.

Note: When running, demonstrate that the gearbox and gearbox train are engaging satisfactorily. Check that the marking of the engine’s “neutral” position is visible from the conning position and corresponds to the impeller’s “stopped” condition. The lifeboat wheel position should have a marking of “midship.”

- Condition of the fabric of the lifeboat, i.e., internal or external cracks, etc. Caution: Report any cracks or other unsafe conditions immediately to the Master/Office.

Note: If the special characteristics of an outboard motor fitted to a rescue boat do not allow it to be run other than with its propeller submerged for a period of 3 minutes, it should be run for such a period as prescribed in the manufacturer's handbook.

- Test the general emergency alarm (SOLAS III/20.6).

- Turn out all lifeboats, except free-fall lifeboats, from their stowed position, without any persons on board if weather and sea conditions allow (SOLAS III/20.6.3).

Carry out monthly inspections of the life-saving appliances, including lifeboat equipment. Use the checklist to ensure that they are complete and in good order. Record a report of the inspection in the logbook (SOLAS III/20.7.2).

###### On-board Maintenance of Life-Saving Equipment

Instructions for on-board maintenance of life-saving appliances shall be:

- Easily understood.

- Illustrated wherever possible.

- Include the following for each appliance:

- A checklist for monthly inspections required by SOLAS III/20.7.2 and III/36.1.

- Maintenance and repair instructions.

- A schedule of periodic maintenance.

- A diagram of lubrication points with recommended lubricants.

- A list of replaceable parts.

- A list of sources of spare parts.

- A log for records of inspections and maintenance (SOLAS III/36).

###### Lifeboat On-Load Release Gear - Maintenance and Test Schedule

Lifeboat on-load release gear shall be:

- Maintained as per on-board maintenance instructions required by SOLAS III/36.

- Subject to a thorough examination and operational test during the annual surveys by properly trained personnel familiar with the system.

- Operationally tested under a load of 1.1 times the total mass of the lifeboat when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment whenever the release gear is overhauled, at least once every five years (SOLAS III/20.11.2).

Caution: A high percentage of accidents at sea are attributed to lifeboats and their release systems.

###### Lifeboat Equipment and Launching Mechanism

Stow each survival craft in a state of continuous readiness so that two crew members can prepare for embarkation and launching in less than 5 minutes (SOLAS III/13.1.3).

Test emergency lighting for mustering and abandonment at each abandon ship drill.

Inspect falls used in launching periodically and renew when necessary due to deterioration or at intervals of not more than 30 months, whichever is earlier.

Note: SOLAS III/20.4.1 requires falls to be renewed if deteriorated or in service for 5 years. The company requirement is to renew falls every 30 months.

Note: Refer to ‘Measures to Prevent Accidents with Lifeboats (MSC.1/Circ.1206)’ with special regard for areas passing through sheaves.

Mark each lifeboat with the:

- Number of persons for which the lifeboat is approved.

- Vessel Name.

- Port of registry.

- Lifeboat Number.

Note: Means of identifying the ship to which the lifeboat belongs, and the number of the lifeboat shall be marked in such a way that they are visible from above (LSA Code IV/4.4.9).

Check the lifting hooks and their associated structure, particularly the connections to the lifeboat keel.

Inspect thoroughly lifeboat recovery mechanisms and associated equipment prior to operation.

Pay special attention to checking “emergency manual crank handles” to ensure they are of proper design as per Maker's manual in relation to the direction of winch shaft rotation.

Note: On some systems, the original design of the manual crank handle ensures that it slips out from the coupling in case of accidental operation of the winch, to avoid it being caught in rotation by the shaft.

Lifeboat equipment is detailed in the LSA Code IV/4.4.8, and the general requirements for enclosed lifeboats are in the LSA Code IV/4.6. However, under SOLAS III/32.3.5, totally enclosed lifeboats carried on ships constructed before 1st July 1986 need not comply with the requirements of the LSA Code IV/4.6.

Note: Always carry out a risk assessment prior to the launching of lifeboats/rescue boats.

###### Firefighting Equipment Maintenance and Inspections

Carry out maintenance, testing, and inspections based on the guidelines in MSC/Circ.850.

The maintenance plan is available in PMS software on board (SOLAS II-2/14.2.2.4).

Keep a record of the age of the foam concentrates and subsequent controls (MSC/Circ.798/5.2).

##### Explosion-Proof and Intrinsically Safe Equipment

Definition of “Dangerous Spaces”

Dangerous spaces are categorized as follows:

- Spaces and tanks containing flammable liquids within 15°C of their flash point or containing flammable gases (e.g., cargo and bunkering tanks).

- Spaces adjacent to these, isolated by a single bulkhead or deck (e.g., cofferdams, ballast tanks, deck stores above cargo or bunkering tanks).

- Piping systems containing flammable liquids or gases, and the enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces containing such piping systems (e.g., pump room).

- Open deck areas extending transversally to the full breadth of the ship, longitudinally up to 3 m forward and aft of the cargo space and the bunkering area, and up to a height of 2.4 m.

- Spherical areas of a 3 m radius around cargo tank openings (e.g., access hatches, tank cleaning openings).

- Cylindrical areas of a 10 m radius around and above cargo and bunker tank venting device exhausts, and cylindrical areas of a 3 m radius around and below cargo and bunker tank venting device exhausts (e.g., areas below and above P/V valve exhausts).

- Spaces below the main deck with direct access to it, but located outside the areas defined above and having no mechanical ventilation.

These spaces commonly have the presence of an explosive atmosphere due to the mixing of flammable gas or vapor with air within the explosive range.

The duration of the explosive atmosphere's presence varies by space category and affects the type of intrinsically safe or explosion-proof electrical equipment allowed. Such categorization is generally found in electrical drawings.

###### Definition and Categorization of Explosion Protection Equipment

Electrical apparatus intended for use in dangerous spaces follow three design principles for explosion protection:

- Explosion Containment: The apparatus can contain an explosion within it, preventing it from igniting the external atmosphere due to its robust enclosure.

- Segregation: Techniques separate electrical components and hot surfaces from the explosive atmosphere using pressurized inert gas, immersion in oils, resins, or special powders.

- Prevention: Apparatus designed to prevent ignition by ensuring electrical components cannot store enough energy or dissipate heat to ignite the explosive atmosphere.

Electrical apparatus’ are categorized according to their design protection type as follows:

Flameproof Enclosure “d”	-	Intrinsic safety “ia” and “ib”

Oil immersion “o”		-	Increased safety “e”

Pressurization “p”		-	Simplified protection “n” (non-incendiary)

Sand filling “q”		-	Encapsulation “m”

Simple apparatus		-	Associated Apparatus

- Protection type “d” falls under the explosion containment principle.

- Protection types “o”, “p”, “q” and “m” fall under the segregation principle.

- Types “i”, “e” and “n” fall under the prevention principle.

As “simple apparatus” are defined those for which the following electrical values are not exceeded: 1.2V, 0.1A, 20μJ / 25mW. These are practically incapable of generating an igniting spark or high temperature and therefore do not require to be designed under any explosion protection principle. Examples are passive sensors, like thermocouples and resistance detectors.

Associated apparatus are devices, parts of which may be located in the dangerous area and the rest in the gas safe area. Even when completely located in the gas safe area, parts of them are galvanically connecting the dangerous area devices to the gas safe area devices. Therefore, associated apparatus must be designed to ensure that no dangerous voltage or current may be transferred to the dangerous area located apparatus.

Design principles ensure the above are used. Typical examples are the use of intrinsic safety principles for the complete circuit of low secondary voltage transformers in active galvanically isolated barriers and use of Zener diodes in passive diode barriers.

Further to the protection type, the explosion protection apparatus are categorized according to the group of explosive gases they are designed for, and the maximum surface temperature they are allowed to develop during their operation.

Explosive gas groups are:

- II A (representative gas: propane).

- II B (representative gas: ethylene).

- II C (representative gases: hydrogen, acetylene).

Surface temperature classes are:

- T1: Maximum surface temp. 450 °C.

- T2: Maximum surface temp. 300 °C.

- T3: Maximum surface temp. 200 °C.

- T4: Maximum surface temp. 135 °C.

- T5: Maximum surface temp. 135 °C.

- T6: Maximum surface temp. 85 °C.

Identification of explosion protection apparatus and space dependent minimum explosion protection requirements.

Explosion protection apparatus are marked for easy identification with:

- The symbol “Ex” or “EEx”.

- The protection type.

- The gas group for which they are suitable.

- The surface temperature class that they will not exceed during operation.

Therefore, a squirrel cage motor identification label may read: Ex “e” II C T4, meaning protection type “Increased Safety”, suitable for explosive gases Group II C (acetylene) and maximum component surface temperature during operation 135 °C.

Electrical components of a gas detector may be identified as: Ex “ia” II A T6, meaning protection type “Intrinsic Safety”, suitable for explosive gases Group II A (propane) and maximum component surface temperature during operation 85 °C.

A lighting fixture installed in the battery room may read Ex “d” II A T6, meaning protection type “Flame Proof”, suitable for gases group II A (propane) and maximum component surface temperature during operation 85 °C.

Associated apparatus are classified in the same manner, with the difference that the type of protection is enclosed in brackets (e.g. [Ex ia] II C, means associated apparatus category “ia”, suitable for connecting apparatus present in group II C gas dangerous atmosphere).

###### Associated/Explosion Protection Apparatus

####### Certification and Design

Explosion protection apparatus’ are certified for installation in dangerous spaces following careful design, performance assessment under specific fault conditions, and extensive testing. The design ensures they are incapable of transferring voltage and current above specified limits to dangerous areas.

####### Installation, Maintenance, and Calibration

Must be carried out strictly per the manufacturer’s instructions by suitably trained and authorized personnel, preferably the maker’s service engineers.

Non-qualified personnel intervention or repairs are prohibited, except for the direct replacement of standard components like fuses or plug-in printed circuit boards, with the manufacturer’s agreement.

####### Precautionary Measures for Calibration and Maintenance

Qualified service engineers, assisted by the C/O and C/E, must take necessary precautionary measures:

- Before and During Calibration/Maintenance: Turn off electrical power or continuously monitor the space atmosphere with an explosion meter to ensure it is out of the explosive range (maximum acceptable LEL 1%).

- Isolate Power: Turn off electrical power and connections to the dangerous space apparatus before maintenance.

- Safe Space for Maintenance: Whenever possible, remove the apparatus to a gas-safe space/workshop for calibration and maintenance.

- Secure Conductors: Firmly anchor disconnected conductors in the dangerous space to an electrically safe point to avoid generating sparks.

####### In-situ Maintenance and Calibration

Should be limited to:

- Disconnection, removal, or substitution.

- Calibration adjustments necessary in situ.

- Maintenance activities specified to be done only in situ by the manufacturer.

###### Programmed Maintenance Tasks for Shipboard Personnel

Carry out specific tasks identified by the manufacturer for non-qualified personnel strictly per agreed instructions and maintenance intervals, using only original spares.

Ensure an adequate stock of spares (fuses, plug-in cards, etc.) is always available onboard.

Follow all precautionary measures, including any additional manufacturer’s instructions, and issue a relevant work permit for jobs in dangerous areas before commencing.

###### Maintenance of Explosion Proof Lighting Fixtures

Maintenance Guidelines

- Flange Faces: Must be clean and without score marks. Do not use metal tools; use only solvent or plastic scrapers.

- Corrosion Prevention: Do not allow the flange faces to become pitted or the gap to become blocked by corrosion or any other material.

- Gap Integrity: Never allow paint to intrude into the gap or seal it with tape, putty, etc. Never insert a gasket between the flange faces.

- Gap Width: Check with a feeler gauge and maintain within the specified range.

- Securing Bolts: When equipment is opened, re-close using all securing bolts. Never over-tighten or leave any bolts loose.

- Cover Bolt Threads: Must be clean and undamaged.

- Pressure Containment Integrity: Ensure the glass cover has no hairline cracks, cover sealing rings are flexible and non-cracked, and glass sealing cement is unbroken.

- Cable Entry Covers/Plates: Must be intact, of the correct type, correctly fitted, and secured.

- Bulb Wattage: Only use bulbs of the wattage for which the light is rated. Using higher wattage bulbs may result in the equipment becoming hotter than its rated temperature.

- Cable and Cage Clips: Ensure they have not worked loose due to vibration.

- Earth/Bonding Connections: Always ensure they remain intact.

These summarized procedures ensure safety and compliance when handling and maintaining explosion-proof and intrinsically safe equipment on board.

###### Malfunction of Explosion Protection or Associated Apparatus

In case of malfunction between programmed maintenance intervals, follow these guidelines:

General Guidance

- No Unauthorized Repairs: Shipboard personnel should not attempt repairs beyond what the manufacturer allows. If interference by shipboard personnel is not allowed, shut down and isolate the power supply per manufacturer’s instructions.

- Request Repairs: Request the technical department to arrange repairs at the first convenient port of call.

Actions in Case of Malfunction

- Inform Company: Report the malfunction or damage sustained to the company.

- Review Manuals: Ensure that all manufacturer’s manuals and drawings are available onboard, studied, and clearly understood by the C/E and/or the electrician. Contact the company and manufacturer in writing if in doubt.

- Partial Repairs: If approved, ensure necessary tools and certified original spare components are available onboard.

Caution: Do not use non-identical spares as they may incapacitate the explosion protection capability of the apparatus.

- Calibration Equipment: Ensure required equipment for calibration is available if non-qualified personnel are to perform calibration.

- Hot Work Permit: Issue a hot work permit for the involved dangerous space(s).

- Power Supply: Disconnect the power supply (and connections to the dangerous area for associated apparatus), open the apparatus to the extent allowed for non-qualified personnel, and assess the condition of interchangeable components.

- Replace Components: Replace damaged components with original certified spares only.

- Reassemble: Carefully reassemble the apparatus, reconnect power and connections to the dangerous area.

- Calibration: Calibrate the apparatus if required and permitted for non-qualified personnel.

General Rules During Intervention

- Avoid Interference: Do not interfere with electrical components responsible for the apparatus’ intrinsic safety, identified by shading on printed circuit boards and connection diagrams.

- Maintain Distances: Do not modify air, surface distances, air gaps of electrical components and conductors, and ensure any gaskets, isolators, and spacing collars are refitted after repairs.

- Grounding: Ensure grounding terminals and conductors of enclosures and safety barriers are intact; do not interfere if not allowed.

- Tight Connections: Ensure power and signal conductors are tightly connected to the correct terminals.

###### Maintenance of Explosion-Proof and Intrinsically Safe Equipment

Caution: Do not carry out weld repairs on any pressure vessel or high-pressure pipeline. In emergencies, contact the technical department for assessment and approval if temporary weld repairs are needed.

###### Shell Plating (Above Water Hull Inspections and Maintenance)

Regularly attend to shell plating maintenance above the waterline, especially the ‘wind and water strake.’ Remove staining below scuppers and under anchors at regular intervals.

Before starting hull work in port, obtain permission from local authorities and follow regulations. Paint the ship’s side from a stage or specially designed painting raft, wearing a lifeline and buoyancy aid with standby crew on deck for assistance.

Warning:

On dry cargo vessels NO work must be undertaken in areas under gantry cranes.

Report any hull indentations (e.g., from contact with jetties, tugs, heavy weather) to the office immediately. Inspect above water shell plating for indentations regularly and complete form ENG 34 “Hull inspection above water” every three months.

###### Methods of Inspecting the Hull

- Use intrinsically safe cameras with terminal permission when the vessel is alongside.

- During crew change at anchorage, using a launch.

- During routine lifeboat exercises.

- During hull cleaning using the same launch.

- During office staff visits to the vessel at anchorage.

- If the complete hull has not been inspected for more than six months, contact TSI for suitable arrangements.

Report any unknown indentations in PMS as a defect, investigate their cause, and inform TSI for proper follow-up. Record the following in PMS:

- Date of damage (if known)

- Cause of damage (e.g., tug, heavy landing)

- Location of damage (frame no. and plate no.) and photographs

- Extent of damage (area, depth, internal damage)

- Reference to shell expansion drawings

###### Deck

Repair and touch up damaged paintwork as soon as practical after damage occurs.

Deck paint should provide a good non-slip surface.

Frequently wash down decks to avoid salt, grit, and other debris buildup. Keep scuppers free of obstruction and de-scale and paint them regularly to reduce staining on the ship’s side.

###### Accommodation

Frequently wash the accommodation block to remove salt, soot, and other deposits.

Treat any staining or corrosion quickly before they spread.

Regularly maintain portholes to prevent staining and corrosion buildup. Check porthole and window opening mechanisms frequently for correct operation, as they may be used as emergency escape routes.

###### Safety Walkways

Maintain markings as per the safety and access plan.

###### Cargo / Ballast tanks and Pipeline

General Inspections

Cargo and ballast tank inspections are limited in scope and aim to:

- Identify gross structural or corrosion-related problems, focusing on suction wells, hopper plates, and stress concentration areas.

- Provide an overall impression of the tank's structural integrity and condition.

- Estimate sediment and mud accumulations.

- Indicate the rate/extent of steel structure wastage.

- Locate and remove debris.

- Ensure coatings meet manufacturer’s guarantees (if applicable).

- Monitor the effectiveness of the cathodic protection system.

Update observations from cargo or ballast tank inspections in the appropriate form in PMS and save photographs in the ship’s electronic filing system. Follow reporting guidance in form 10.4.1A Appendix III.

###### Cargo Holds (Dry Cargo Vessels)

Maintaining cargo holds on container vessels is challenging when constantly loaded with cargo.

Note: If practical, request the charterer to leave a section of a hold empty for maintenance, considering stability and stress.

Ventilate cargo holds to reduce sweat or moisture, preventing corrosion and cargo damage.

Inspect and maintain cargo holds at intervals not exceeding one month. Record results, including:

- Structural deterioration and failure.

- Corrosion, pitting, and wastage extent.

- Deterioration of any coating.

- Leakages in bulkheads or pipework.

- Ballast tanks manhole covers and gaskets.

- Bilge and strum box condition.

- Note: Bulk carriers should inspect holds after cargo discharge and report any damages.

Follow the ship’s PMS and Company Form "Monthly Cargo Hold Maintenance Record." Adjust forms as needed for container ship layouts.

###### Pitting Repairs

Pitting, a result of localized corrosion, affects horizontal surfaces and can be shallow or deep.

- Shallow pitting (<33% of plate thickness) may be repaired with a suitable epoxy compound, applied per manufacturer’s instructions.

- Deep pits (>33% of plate thickness) may be repaired by welding if the material left at the pit's bottom exceeds 6 mm. Welding procedures must be followed.

- Clean and prepare pitting for repair by welding. Use suitable electrodes from an approved class list for the grade of steel. A minimum of four weld beads are required, with stop and start positions outside the pit and alternating welding direction.

- Extensive pitting (>25% of surface area or >50% of original thickness) requires cropping and renewing the affected plating.

###### Ballast Tank Coating

Maintain ballast and cargo tanks in “GOOD” condition per classification standards. "POOR" condition is unacceptable, and "FAIR" condition requires remedial actions.

- The crew must repair and re-coat areas of coating breakdown due to mechanical damage or pitting whenever conditions permit. Extensive repairs beyond the crew's capabilities will be arranged by a shipyard or subcontractor.

- Ballast tank maintenance requires experienced personnel. Refer to “Guidelines for the inspection and maintenance of double hull tanker structures” and MSC.1/Circ.1330 for protective coating maintenance and repair guidelines.

- Follow manufacturer’s instructions for maintenance products and consult material safety data sheets.

Note: any coating breakdown shall be recorded as a “defect” in the PMS.

###### Anodes in Tanks

Ballast tanks may be fitted with zinc sacrificial anodes for tank surface cathodic protection.

Monitor anodes and replace them when consumed.

If fully coated tanks are not provided with anodes, consider temporary installation based on a tank-specific study when the coating deteriorates. Remove these anodes once the tank is re-coated.

Caution: Do not use aluminum anodes.

###### Ballast Tank Cleaning

Remove sediment during ballast tank inspections, if necessary. Record unusual observations like excessive sediment and reasons for not removing sediment in the ballast tank inspection PMS form.

###### Additional Requirements

Conduct general condition inspections on tankers per the 'Guidelines for the Inspection and Maintenance of Double-Hull Tankers.'

Monitor coatings and cathodic protection system effectiveness. Support reports of wastage with thickness readings using intrinsically safe measuring devices.

Measure pipeline thicknesses during general condition inspections to track wastage trends at fixed points.

###### Inspections

Regularly inspect all cargo tanks, ballast tanks, and void spaces to ensure integrity. When a defect is identified (structural, coating system, etc.), the responsible officer shall:

- Report the finding to the Office with its possible cause.

- Record the finding as a “Defect” in the PMS software

- Take appropriate corrective action.

Conduct Fatigue Analysis CAP after the 3rd Special Survey (when a vessel is over 15 years old), unless already available earlier or from the vessel’s builder.

Note: The Company aims to obtain CAP rating 1 for each area

##### Steel Work and Renewal Policy

The company conducts regular steel thickness measurements per Class requirements.

Crop and renew structural members with defined “renewal” wastage and those with “substantial” corrosion.

Areas with “substantial” wastage (>15% for plating) are included in steel renewals and replaced with material of equivalent thickness and strength during the next major repair period.

Note: Apply relevant class rules for “renewal” and “substantial” wastage limits to each vessel.

The superintendent, in cooperation with the C/O, must check steel work progress:

- Verify steel repair markings before cropping starts, according to IACS recommendations.

- Ensure the correct material, as per construction drawings, is provided and class certificates are obtained.

- Check edge preparation, welding root gaps, welding area cleanliness, and member alignment per IACS recommendations during plate fitting.

- Arrange joint inspection programs with the yard quality control department to ensure acceptable weld quality and adherence to company and classification standards. Follow correct and class-approved welding procedures and use approved consumables.

- Conduct non-destructive examination (NDE) per company and class requirements, in the presence of the superintendent or assigned officer and the class surveyor.

##### Maintenance records

The chief officer and/or chief engineer must maintain comprehensive records of inspections, tests, maintenance, and repairs in the PMS software.

Any structural or coating system defect or damage shall be recorded as a “defect” in the ship’s PMS; and an Investigation to identify the potential causes must be conducted and available.

In the event of a PMS computer/software failure, keep paper records until the system is restored. This is especially important for items that are part of a statutory survey to demonstrate to port state control inspectors that there is a controlled maintenance system on board and to allow the technical superintendent to gauge maintenance effectiveness.

The PMS records must be backed up weekly to ensure maintenance records are preserved.

## 10.4 Bunkering Management



### 10.4.1 Bunkering Procedure - rev 0 issued 13.12.2024

##### Bunkering Operations - FO, DO and/or Lubricants in Bulk

###### Introduction

If possible, before bunkering, the C/E should transfer fuel/lube oil to only fill "empty tanks" on the ship.

ONLY one grade at a time to be bunkered. No simultaneous bunkering.

Caution!	Do not carry out any internal bunker transfers during the bunkering operation.

Company policy is to avoid any comingling, if this is not possible, then fuel will be transferred within the Ship to minimize "co-mingling" of new fuel/lube oil with that already on board.

Note: Comingling ratio to be agreed with the office.

Under all normal circumstances, no bunker/ lube oil tank will be filled up beyond 95%. However, if the tank is to be filled above 95%, a thorough Risk Assessment must be conducted, and prior permission taken from the office.

The Chief Engineer is responsible for and in charge of bunkering operations and will, therefore, be onboard for the duration of all such operations.

Before the commencement of the Bunkering operation, Form "ENG 05A- Bunkering Plan" (BUNKERING PLAN OVERVIEW – Part I) is to be completed by the Chief Engineer and distributed to the Chief Officer and designated personnel involved in the bunkering operation.

Ensure there are always enough personnel assigned for the Bunkering operation to ensure adequate coverage as per the requirements.

Before all bunkering operations, the Chief Engineer will complete a survey of all fuel tanks on board the vessel and form "ENG 05A- BUNKERING PLAN OVERVIEW – Part II".

###### Communications

For communications, the minimum requirement for the following personnel is to be in constant touch via "walkie-talkies", backed up by "Bunkering telephones" and the Ship's main telephone system as appropriate:

- Chief Engineer as PIC (Person in Charge)

- Engineer or rating taking ullages/soundings.

- Duty Engineer in Engine Room.

- Bunker manifold watchman.

- Duty Deck Officer.

- Deck watchman - if he is not the same person as in (d) above.

The Duty Deck Officer will also maintain a communications link with the bunker supplier via the Ship's fixed VHF from the Wheelhouse or CCR as appropriate.

If the bunker supplier provides a hand-held VHF set, then this is to be in the possession of the Chief Engineer to permit direct communication. Ensure that Handheld VHF is synced in the same channel.

###### Planning of Bunker Operations

The Chief Engineer shall prepare a detailed bunker plan well in advance.

The plan shall cover all stages of the operation and, as a minimum, contain:

- Quantity and grade of bunker.

- Density, temperature, and other relevant properties (Based on CoQ and later on corrected to BDN if any discrepancies between the two).

- Request for Certificate of Quality (CoQ) before bunkering.

- In case a Biofuel is bunkered CoQ BDN vessel should also ask for the PoS "Proof of sustainability"

Caution!: Avoid keeping bunkers on board for a long time without using them, hence preventing precipitation and sedimentation.

- After receiving the voyage fixture, the Ship's management (Master and C/E) will contact the Operations department to plan the bunkering of fuels for the intended voyage for quantity, quality grade and segregation possibilities onboard. Take into consideration minimum bunker reserves.

###### Checks and Precautions

####### Before Bunkering

The Chief Engineer is to obtain from the bunker supplier details of the specification of the fuel oil to be loaded. The minimum requirements for such a specification are:

- Specific Gravity, API. or Density.

- Viscosity and loading temperature.

- And pumping rate

The Chief Engineer shall:

- Analyse the risks involved.

- Discuss the risk assessment with all involved crew members and the bunker plan.

- Verify the operation and accuracy of the gauging system and high-level alarms before bunkering.

- Before bunker ensure that all storage (FO/LO) tank valves are closed.

Caution! Never bunker directly into a settling or service tank

Discuss the below points and ensure all the involved personnel understand the same.

- Avoid bunkering multiple tanks – if unavoidable, continuously monitor all the bunkering tanks by manually sounding them.

- Monitor all the other tanks not involved in the current bunkering operation.

- Seal or hang the sign “DO NOT OPEN” on the bunker tank valves which not involved in bunkering, to prevent accidental opening.

- The bunkering operation RA must include the hazards from executing Simultaneous operations (receiving stores & spares, inspection by internal/external parties) and ensure that the bunkering team will not be involved in any other operation and stays focused on bunkering.

- Plan sufficient manpower and ensure all the crew members have adequate rest to comply with the STCW requirements.

Caution! Do not assign any other duties to personnel involved directly in bunkering operation.

- Verify the procedure for changing bunker tanks during bunkering operation- simulate with the team.

Table.1 Rates corresponding to 1 meter/second.

(the table shows approximate volumetric flow rates corresponding to the linear velocity of 1 meter / second in the piping of various diameters.)

*Note: Note that the diameters given are nominal diameters, which are not necessarily the same as the actual internal diameters

- The Chief Engineer is to ensure the fuel sampling device is correctly set up and arrangements made to take a continuous drip sample throughout the entire bunkering period, as per the fuel testing manual.

- The "ISGOTT Bunker checklist: Pre-Arrival" section of form "ENG 05 – ISGOTT Bunkering Checklist" is to be filled in by the Chief Engineer and supplier's representative.

Note: Test bunker tanks atmosphere using a gas analyzer/tubes and record the values for H2S and Benzene in the Checklist. Ensure all crewmembers involved in the operation are advised on the safety precautions required to be taken to avoid exposure to toxic gases (i.e. wearing a personal gas detector, methods to avoid exposure, etc…).

- The Chief Engineer will enter a remark if the supplier's representative declines to witness or sign the form. Letter of protest for “ Deviation from Pre-Bunkering Agreement “ to be issued for refusal and sent to the barge via the agent.

Caution!

Do not pre-sign any fuel oil sample receipt forms/labels at this time.

Vessel sample drawn from the receiving vessel's manifold, MUST be included on the BDN, as required by ISO 13739:2020, MEPC.182(59), bunkering principles and our company procedures. If supplier’s representative refuse to do then LOP “For not including vessel sample to the BDN” will be issued by CE.

- When delivery is ex-barge safe, access to and from the barge is to be arranged for:

- Barge personnel to board the receiving vessel to connect hoses and witness the vessel's tank gauging.

- The Chief Engineer or his designated representative will witness the ullaging of ALL the barge's tanks and check the barge's sampling equipment (if fitted).

- Check the trim and list of the barge.

Note: Some barges tend to maintain a trim which is not supported by the calibration table. The barge will have to accept and transfer fuel to tanks so that the trim will be within the calibration table. If not, LOP should be raised so that barge measurements cannot be justified.

- Check and record the temperature of each barge tank.

- Inspect measuring equipment and confirm it is not tampered with.

- For barge quantity calculation do not trust computers and check the authenticity of the calibration table.

- When delivery is ex-terminal, the Chief Engineer, whenever possible, should witness meter readings if these are sited adjacent to the vessel and provided permission is granted to proceed into the terminal. For Singapore Mass Flow Meter (MFM) is used instead.

The "ISGOTT Bunker checklist: checks after mooring" section of the form "ENG 05 – ISGOTT Bunkering Checklist" must be filled in by the Chief Engineer and supplier's representative.

Then, the Chief Engineer will fill in the ISGOTT Bunker checklist: Pre-bunkering" section of form "ENG 05 – ISGOTT Bunkering Checklist" in consultation with his team and deck crew assisting the bunkering operations.

####### During Bunkering

The Chief Engineer assigned engineer-in-charge & OOW shall do this procedure.

OOW shall:

- Display the required signals.

- Make any necessary reports to port authorities.

- Supervise mooring/unmooring of bunker vessel/barge.

The Chief Engineer shall:

- Complete the Bunker checklist: "ENG 05 – ISGOTT Bunkering Checklist" in consultation with his team and deck crew assisting the bunkering operations.

- Conduct a key meeting with the supplier, after the vessel is moored, to agree:

- The quantity and quality of bunkers requested (check the certificate of quality)

- Initial, bulk and topping-off rates

- The sequence of bunkering (if more than one grade)

- The notices required to increase/reduce flow rates and stop pumping.

- Maximum transfer pressures in the pipeline

Caution! If the supplier doesn't agree with the sampling procedure to be taken on the receiving vessel, then an LOP will be issued for any discrepancy between what was agreed and what was set in practice. Letter of protest to be issued: For breach of sampling preparation procedure.

Note: All sample bottles should be placed in open view of the receiving vessel.

- Manually sound all bunker tanks (including non-nominated bunker).

- Calculate and confirm the receiving rate on an hourly basis.

- Reduce the receiving rate during the topping-up or changeover to the topping-up rate.

- Maintain close communication with the bunker barge all the time.

Caution! Do not receive more than one grade of bunkers at the same time.

- Ensure that the lines are drained/or blown as required at the end of the operation.

Note: Follow precautions for line draining and blowing described below

####### After Bunkering

The Chief Engineer shall:

- Complete the ISGOTT Bunker checklist: Post-bunkering" section of form "ENG 05 – ISGOTT Bunkering Checklist" in consultation with his team for bunkering operations.

- Complete the ISGOTT Bunker checklist – Declaration. Any discrepancies observed to be mentioned.

- After the bunkering operation is complete ensure all required documentation and ORB is updated.

Caution!  If there will arise any remark or dispute during conferences with suppliers' representatives, then the Ship's representative (CE) will issue a LOP in consultation with the Master and inform the office. Letter of protest to be issued: LOP Pre-Bunkering Agreement”

Caution!  If the supplier’s representative do not accept to include vessel sample to the BDN, then the Ship's representative (CE) will issue a LOP in consultation with the Master and inform the office. Letter of protest to be issued: LOP For not including vessel sample to the BDN”

Note: Letter of protests standard wording attached to the Appendix of this section.

##### Daily Internal Oil Transfers (fuel and lubricants)

###### Responsibility

The chief engineer is fully responsible for transfer operations and shall:

- Plan the internal fuel transfer operations

- Assign a responsible Engineer for carrying out the planned transfer

- Carry out a toolbox talk with all crew involved in the transfer operation

- Complete checklist ENG 30 – Internal Bunker Transfer

- Supervise the transfer operations

There are two types of fuel / lubeoil transfers:

- Automatic transfers

- Non-automatic transfers

Note: Automatic transfer should be avoided during the Engine Room in UMS mode and at nighttime, where applicable.

Caution: If it becomes necessary to transfer bunkers from one storage bunker tank to another, it should be treated as bunkering operation. The same applies to any manual transfer where the bunkering deck lines are involved. Follow ENG 30 – “Internal Bunker Transfer Checklist”.

Internal Oil Transfer Procedure

The chief engineer shall prepare an oil transfer plan.

The EOOW shall follow the plan.

- Before the transfer, the Chief Engineer shall draft a plan for the intended transfer, including such information as:

- The assignment of duties of personnel involved in the transfer

- The quantity of fuel oil/ lub oil to be transferred,

- The tanks to be used

- The total height or void in the tanks expected after completing the transfer.

- Fuel oil lines to be used

- Fuel system valves line-up

- Method of draining the fuel lines after completion of transfer

- Prior to commencement of the transfer, the chief engineer shall conduct a toolbox meeting and inform all involved parties about the pipe systems, valves and tanks to be used. Inform them also about the agreed transfer interruption procedure in the event of emergency.

- Inform Master, C/O and the OOW regarding the transfer

- Make readily available the MSDS and other safety information related to the specific chemical composition of the fuel and/or lub oil to be transferred.

- Ensure that piping plans related to the transfer are readily available for consultation, indicating the location of each valve, pump, control device, vent, and overflow and also location of the shutoff valve or other isolation device that separates any bilge or ballast system from the transfer system.

- Implement measures required:

- For safety

- For fire prevention

- To avoid environmental pollution.

Note: Use form ENG 30 – Internal Bunker Transfer Checklist

- Make a relevant E/R Log entry.

- Pay attention to the following:

- Close the deck scuppers. The oil spill tanks under the tank vents shall be empty and capped.

- Prepare SOPEP equipment

- Test and verify that the small oil pollution pump is operational

- Close all fuel intake connections using blind gaskets and tighten all screws

- Check the condition of the whole system used in the internal transfer process, such as pipes, valves, expansion joints, etc.

- Prepare the necessary fire protection equipment near the point of the transfer and keep ready for use in the event of emergency

- Check for sources of ignition near the air vents of the fuel tanks

- Monitor the checks, measurements and actions required for the safety of the procedure and pollution prevention constantly throughout the transfer

- Leave sufficient empty space in the tanks to allow for the expansion of fuel when heated.

- The Chief Engineer shall fulfill any specific requirements of the oil transfer procedures as per local port state regulations, such as 33 CFR 155.750 for U.S. regulated waters.

- Upon completion, record details of transfer procedures in the Engine Log Book

Completed

##### Draining and Blowing the Bunker Lines/Hoses

This guidance applies:

- After bunkering operations

- After internal transfer of fuel, when bunker system deck piping is used.

ISGOTT recommends that - "Blowing lines with air into a receiving ship's bunker tanks introduces several safety risks and is not recommended". (ISGOTT 6 Para. 24.2.1)

However, in practice blowing of lines may be required. In such case follow below guidance.

After pumping is completed, the bunker supplier may blow the line through with compressed air to ensure all the fuel is out of the line before disconnection at the bunker manifold.

If blowing by air is unavoidable, be aware of the safety implications of this operation, and therefore:

- Ensure that pipe disconnection has not commenced before line-blowing.

- Ensure that no system valves have been closed before line-blowing.

- Take care near the bunker pipe, as it may move violently during line-blowing.

- Be aware that a highly flammable oil mist may be present in the bunker line during disconnection caused by the blowing-through action. All safety precautions are to be followed closely.

- Vessel’s Chief Engineer should not allow the bunker tanker to ‘strip’ their tanks or blow through the lines, towards the end of the bunkering. If the supplier insists on air blowing, direct this blow through to a non-nominated bunker tank of the vessel.

- Check for ‘bubbles’ on the measuring tape when the soundings of the tanks are obtained.

- The final vessel’s measurements should be checked twice (depending on time availability) to ensure that there’s no drop in soundings. A drop in sounding would indicate an unstable oil level within the tank.

- Issue letter of protest with remarks ‘bubbles’ noted, and unstable soundings obtained which, contribute to inaccurate vessel’s received quantity.

Caution! If CE has any doubt about the quantity of bunkers received, Letter of protest to be issued: LOP for Discrepancy Bunkers”.

If the lines are blown, ensure bunker tanks are filled at less than 75% capacity.

Instruct the barge/terminal to blow the lines under controlled pressure and volume. Communicate with barge/terminal to not exceed 2-3 bar.

Note: No hot work should be carried out near vents/bulkheads, etc for the first 12-24 hours (at least).

Caution! Do not blow lines containing distillate fuels (MDO, MGO). Instead, only draining of the hose is accepted.

##### Bunkering via Terminal Pipeline

Follow all procedures and instructions given in the bunkering procedure.

In addition, the Master/Chief Officer shall:

- Implement and follow all the applicable instructions in the TANK 09 - Ship Shore Safety Check List.

- If the vessel is also involved in cargo operation, liaise with the marine & safety superintendent to ensure that bunkering is allowed concurrently, i.e. if any owner, terminal, charterers or other party have conflicting instructions, to avoid possible contamination claims.

Note: follow Simultaneous Operations procedure

At terminals, a shore team is usually responsible for the connection/disconnection of the bunker hose/arm. The engineer in charge shall supervise the operation.

##### Bunkering via Barge, Alongside or at Anchor

Follow all procedures and instructions given in the above bunkering procedure

If the operation is planned alongside the Chief Officer, shall implement and follow all the applicable instructions in the TANK 09 - Ship Shore Safety Checklist.

If the vessel is also involved in cargo operation, liaise with the marine & safety superintendent to ensure:

- That bunkering is allowed concurrently, i.e. if any owner, terminal, charterers or other party have conflicting instructions, to avoid possible contamination claims

- That the crew stands by in advance to assist with the mooring/unmooring of the barge.

- That portable fenders are available for the mooring operation to prevent hull damage.

- That transfer hoses and equipment are in good order. Request a copy of the certificate for the

- hose(s) used for transfer.

- Safe access for personnel transfer between the Ship and barge.

- That authorities are informed, as required.

##### Bunker Quality Check

The Chief Engineer or designated engineer shall do this procedure.

- Check the supplier's documents to ensure that the products being delivered correspond in terms of quantity and fuel specification with what has been ordered

Note:	Check that you have received the Certificate of Quality from the supplier.

- About 5 minutes after bunkering has started, take a sample from the manifold

- Test the initial Sample for the following:

- Specific gravity

- Water content

- Viscosity

- Compatibility (fuel – The rest may be applicable in lube only)

- Record the initial test reports in the bunker report.

- Complete form ENG26.  If requested, send the form to the technical department.

- Use the continuous drip line sampler to collect samples from:

- Barge/shore installation

Caution!  Confirm that the barge is taking samples through a drip oil sampler. If the sampling procedure was agreed and, supplier’s do not respect it, then CE will issue a LOP: “For breach of sampling preparation procedure”

- Vessel’s manifold

- Land the collected samples for a full analysis on every occasion.

###### Bunker Delivery Note (BDN)

The bunker supplier shall provide a bunker delivery note (BDN) showing the as-delivered fuel parameters of density at 15 deg C (kg/m3) and the Sulphur content (% m/m) by mass.

As of 01 May 2024, Flash Point should be recorded on the BDN as per MEPC 79.

The BDN shall also contain:

- The name and IMO number of the Ship

- The port and date of delivery of bunkers

- Commencement date of the delivery

- The name, address and telephone number of the supplier

- The product name and quantity are in metric tones

- The density as determined by a test method appropriate to the fuel type together with the associated temperature

- The flash point value of the fuel if it is below 70°C, or a statement that the flash point was measured and found above 70°C,

- A declaration signed and certified by the supplier's representative that the fuel oil supplied is in conformity with regulation 18.3 of Annex VI and that the Sulphur content, does not cause an engine to exceed the applicable NOx limits, does not contain inorganic acid, does not jeopardize the safety of the ship or adversely affect he performance of the machinery, and is not harmful to personnel or contribute to overall additional air pollution

- Documentation of the actual Sulphur content as determined by a test method appropriate to the type of fuel, or with the agreement of the appropriate authority at the port of supply, a statement that the Sulphur content, when tested is less that 0.001 % m/m

- The fuel oil supplier's representative shall complete the declaration by marking the applicable box(es) with a cross (x)."

Note: The bunker supplier and the vessel shall each retain a copy of the bunker delivery note (BDN) for at least 3 years

Caution! For any abnormalities noticed issue LOP and inform all concerned parties.

Unless less water content has been specified, the maximum allowable water content is 0.02% (or 200 mg/kg) for MDO and 0.5% for HFO.

Note:	These levels allow for water contamination in storage, handling, transportation and delivery facilities.

##### Bunker Disputes

The master/chief engineer shall do this procedure

Note: Dispute related to violation of MARPOL Annex VI to be treated as dispute for Off-specification bunker dispute

In case of any disputes relating to MARPOL annex VI regulations or to the quality or quantity of bunkers delivered:

Immediately seek advice from the vessel’s technical department.

Advise the charterer and chartering department immediately of any dispute that may arise.

Consider calling in the local P & I representative to protect the interests of the owner.

Make appropriate remarks in the receipt detailing the complaints and referring to a separate note of protest.

Issue a letter of protest and send it via agent to all parties (owners, charterers, suppliers, charterers’ agent)

Draw up statement of facts including records of all soundings, ullages and calculations before and after the bunker operations.

Send a copy of the letter of protest, statement of facts together with a copy of the bunker delivery receipt, as soon as possible to the charterers and/or charterer’s agent and owners.

Secure the bunker manifold samples and any samples provided by the bunker supplier.

Caution: Bunker disputes can be, and often are, very costly. The success of any such dispute will depend upon the quality of evidence collected in support of the claim. Collect all evidence at every bunkering operation to enable owners defend or make a bunker claim. Present these evidence in the event of quantity or quality problems.

Provide evidence regarding:

Bunker system maintenance and testing

Pre-arrival checks / bunkering checklist

Bunker start up and completion times

Sounding/ullage records

Bunker tank readings

Compliance with procedures and best practice

Completed bunker checks

Log book entries (deck, engine logbooks)

Oil record book entries

All bunker related communications

Avoid quantity problems by carrying out comprehensive pre-loading and completion surveys.  When conducting bunker surveys consider trim corrections, temperature readings and volume corrections figures.

Note:	In order to calculate the weight of fuel loaded the chief engineer shall know the density of the fuel loaded. At the time of bunkering, and unless the ship has a means of determining the density, the ship shall assume the density given by the supplier to be correct.

On completion of bunkering the chief engineer should sign the bunker delivery receipt ‘for volume at observed temperature only’ simply because without confirmed knowledge of the fuel density it is impossible to determine the weight of fuel lifted.

Note:	Once loaded, bunkers require onboard treatment to prepare and care for the fuel.

In the event of a quality dispute, provide records of fuel treatment, including:

Details such as which tanks are/have been used

When they were used

For how long they were used

Note:	Engineers shall be able to recognize early indications of problematic bunkers and act accordingly.

Record all actions taken and their impact.

Retain damaged components on board;

Compile photographic evidence, video evidence, as also any survey reports.

###### Evidence Collection and Preservation

Disputes arising from bunker quality are multiple, often obstructed by insufficient evidence including representative samples and fuel analysis reports.

The consequences of burning off-specification bunkers can be severe, possibly leading to the breakdown of the vessel’s machinery.

Even where off-specification bunkers do not result in a breakdown, the loss of time and expenses incurred if it is necessary to de-bunker or deviate to stem fresh bunkers can be significant

To mitigate the risk of fuel-related engine damage and downtime, and to strengthen evidence for potential bunker quality claims, adopting preventive measures and procedures is essential.

The Chief Engineer shall:

Adhere to the owner’s IMS procedures for bunkering

If appointed, the bunker surveyor should perform an independent investigation to identify the cause of any quality issues and discrepancies. They shall also assist in the sampling and sealing process.

Document all events during the bunkering operation, including start/stop times, flow rates and any unexpected stoppages

Thoroughly plan for the preparation of the receiving bunker tank(s), prioritising tasks such as inter-tank transfers if operationally critical, before bunkering to ensure alignment with industry standards.

Verify the suitability and condition of receiving bunker tanks before bunkering.

If ‘off-spec’ bunkers have been delivered, a case-by-case approach should be followed. Contact Office for advice.

Caution: Should the chief engineer have any concerns or find the test results unsatisfactory, a letter of protest must be issued, clearly stating the reason for the protest, and an entry must be made in the engine logbook to document the concern / circumstances. Do not sign the Bunker Delivery Note (BDN); instead, promptly contact the owners, charterers, and/or the local P&I correspondent to determine the next course of action.

The following documents should be retained; however, it is crucial to adapt and expand this list based on the unique circumstances and challenges of each case:

Certificate of quality/analysis: Provided by the supplier, reporting the quality standards of the bunker fuel.

Pre/post bunker meeting & checklists (ENG 05-05A;05B;05C): Includes operational and safety checklists such as, but not limited to, the pre-delivery safety checklist and Mass Flow Meter (MFM) System Seals checklist, verifying applicable precautions are taken before and after delivery.

Ensuring effective bunkering requires careful preparation, watchful operation, and thorough documentation to prevent and resolve quantity and quality disputes.

##### Fuel Oil Sampling Procedures

###### Witnessing of Sampling

It is a standard and a condition of the contemporary bunker industry to regard barge/shoreline manifold samples as binding to determine the final quality of product supplied in case of dispute.

Hence, it is essential to ensure that in addition to the vessel's manifold Sample, a vessel representative participates and witnesses the taking and sealing of the barge/shore manifold sample.

Further, to give the vessel's manifold samples more value, it is also required to invite the Bunkering Master/Barge Representative to witness the drawing of sealed samples at the Ship's manifold.

He/she should also be requested to countersign all Ship's manifold samples. In case of refusal, issue a letter of protest to the company Commercial Operator and Charter to be informed immediately.

The only exemption of the above is Singapore, where the official Sample has to be taken at the point of custody transfer, i.e., the Ship's manifold. See Appendix SS600 – Singapore Standard SS600 (Amended) – Sampling Procedures (Key Steps)

###### Sampling

The sample of the fuel oil delivered to the ship should be obtained at the receiving ship's inlet bunker manifold and should be drawn continuously throughout the bunker delivery period.

The sampling operation itself should be witnessed by both the ship’s and supplier’s representatives.

Attach the container receiving the primary Sample to the sampling equipment and seal to prevent tampering or contamination of the Sample throughout the bunker delivery period.

Caution! Do not accept samples prepared in advance by the supplier or the barge captain. Ensure the drip sampler is also in the Barge manifold and that samples will be prepared in front of them. Otherwise, LOP may be considered about the origin/validity of samples. Letter of protest to be issued: For breach of sampling preparation procedure”.

Take representative samples of the fuel delivered using one of the following methods:

- Manual valve setting continuous drip sampler.

- Time proportional automatic sampler

- Flow proportional automatic sampler

- Use an automatic sampling device if fitted.

###### Definitions

Definitions as per MSC-MPEC 2/Circ.18   – Guidelines for the sampling of fuel oil for determination of compliance with Annex VI and SOLAS Chapter II-2.

The supplier's representative is the individual from the bunker barge responsible for the delivery and documentation or, in the case of deliveries direct from the shore to the Ship, the person responsible for the delivery and documentation.

The Ship's representative is the Ship's Master or the officer responsible for receiving bunkers and documentation.

A representative Sample is a product specimen with physical and chemical characteristics identical to the average characteristics of the total volume sampled.

The primary Sample is the representative Sample of the fuel delivered to the Ship collected throughout the bunkering period obtained by the sampling equipment positioned at the bunker manifold of the Receiving Ship.

The retained Sample is the representative Sample by regulation 18 (6) of ANNEX VI MARPOL 73/78 of the fuel delivered to the Ship derived from the primary Sample.

###### Drawing the sample

The sample shall be drawn by a continuous drip method.

After drawing the sample:

- Shake the cubitainer vigorously to homogenize fuel before filling the sample bottles.

- Fill the bottles in 3 stages and in-between shake the cubitainer

- In case fuel loses the flow properties, e.g when bunkering is a cold area, submerge the cubitainer is hot water (Ben Marry) to heat it.

Note: The retained sample should be of sufficient quantity to perform the tests required but should not be less than 600 ml.

###### Samples management

Immediately following collection of the retained sample, a tamper-proof security seal, with a unique means of identification, should be installed by the supplier's representative in the presence of the ship's representative.

Follow below guidance:

- Seal the sample container after filling it to 90% (+/- 5%) capacity.

- In the presence of the Ship's Chief Engineer, the supplier's representative should install a tamper-proof security seal with a means of identification as soon as the retained MARPOL sample is collected.

- Raise an LOP if samples were not prepared in front of the vessel representative and a “saba cup” sample was given. The SABA cups can be tampered with easily.

Note: Vessels are enrolled in the bunker analysis program with a designated shore lab.

- Use the relevant submission form and print/paste labels in the samples.

- Courier order details should be provided to the agent to book the sample pick up and redirection to the nearest lab for analysis.

- Additionally, record the seal identification details on the bunker delivery note (BDN).

- Retain the MARPOL sample for at least 12 months from delivery or until the bunkers have been substantially consumed, whichever comes first.

Caution!	Do not use the MARPOL sample to resolve quality disputes other than those prescribed by Annex VI and verify the supplier's compliance with Annex VI.

If required to hand a sample to a port state control authority, maintain a record of the sample custody transfer in the engine logbook with specific reference to:

- The sample label details and seal number.

- The port, date, and time of handover of the Sample

- The identity of the person to whom the Sample was handed, together with the name, signature and authority stamp as appropriate.

- Contact details of those who will hold custody of the Sample.

Other sample bottles should be:

- Sealed, dated, and signed by the vessel and local supplier.

- Marked with port of delivery, name of supplier and grade of fuel.  All samples should have labels will minimum information (such as port, grade, date, etc.)

Take four identical samples. For Singapore, you must take five samples.

- 1 Marpol Sample

Note: The Marpol sample is unique and is the one marked as MARPOL in the BDN and this is provided by the supplier. The Marpol sample taken from the vessel is just a retained commercial sample.

- 1 for Ship

- 1 for bunker tanker

- 1 for surveyor (if engaged) – (Singapore +1 for surveyor)

- 1 for Ship to send to testing lab (if applicable) – Singapore.

If the analysis is not available and you have to start using fuel coordinate with the office and do a risk assessment. Complete ENG 26 form.

These are necessary to:

- Consideration the hazards connected with using the fuel without having the lab test result

- Monitor the fuel oil service system and components' performance

- Changeover to MGO in case of a compatibility test failure, with the approval of the TSI

Use the fuel as directed by the technical department team.

###### Samples labelling

A label containing the following information should be secured to the retained sample container:

- location at which, and the method by which, the sample was drawn.

- date of commencement of delivery.

- name of bunker tanker/bunker installation.

- name and IMO number of the receiving ship.

- signatures and names of the supplier's representative and the ship's representative.

- details of seal identification.

- product name as per appendix V of MARPOL Annex VI.

To facilitate cross reference details of the seal, identification should also be recorded on the bunker delivery note

Caution!: MAPPOL sample is not used for any commercial purposes. MARPOL sample is meant for the authorities only.

A vessel sample for the barge is not required.

##### Bunkering Lubricating Oils & Lubricants Procedure

Chief Engineer shall:

- Plan lubeoil bunkering

- Take care not to mix lubricating oils of different grades.

- Appoint an engineer to coordinate the bunkering operation. Use the ‘Bunkering plan’ and 'Bunkering checklist'.

Note:	The delivery note should specify the quantity and the grade of lubricating oil.

The supplier and the chief engineer should sign the delivery note.

Retain the original on board and forward a copy to the technical department.

If lubricating oil spills, follow the procedures outlined in the shipboard oil pollution emergency plan (SOPEP).

###### Receiving Lubricants in Packaged Form

Various types of lubricants are sometimes delivered in packaged form, i.e. in metal drums or cans.

The Chief Engineer shall:

- Conduct a risk assessment to identify all safety and environmental hazards and implement mitigation measures.

- Hold a toolbox talk with all crewmembers involved, ensuring all measures and precautions are understood

- Appoint an officer or engineer to supervise the entire operation

Caution: Test the lifting gear before the operations.

###### Lube Oil Sampling

The Chief Engineer shall:

### 10.5.2 Spares, Stores, and Provisions - rev 0 issued 13.12.2024

##### Services, Spares, Stores and Provisions

###### Introduction

This procedure provides guidance on conducting services and supplying stores, spares, and provisions to the fleet in a cost-effective and timely manner, considering the urgency of spare parts and the vessel's schedule.

Vessels may purchase small quantities of stores and provisions, with limits up to $2000 USD per month, if approval from the Technical Department is obtained. This will:

- Reduce administration for the purchase of low-cost items.

- Allow masters to obtain better prices when purchasing provisions and stores using cash.

The superintendents/purchasing officer shall monitor this expenditure carefully when coding the master’s cash account.

The master and the technical department are jointly responsible for the budget for provisions.

The company has established minimum stock levels for critical spare parts, consumables and tools, via a hazard analysis / risk assessment process presented in the e-PMS The C/E shall ensure that these stock levels are always maintained on board.

Bring shortages immediately to the attention of the master and the technical department via the e-PMS. The C/E should issue a requisition at the earliest convenience, in order effort is made to replace as soon as possible.

###### Selection of Spares, Stores, and Service Companies Guidance

The superintendent/purchasing officer and vessel staff shall follow these guidelines:

- The superintendent/ purchasing officer should select spare parts on the basis of quality, delivery lead times, convenience port of delivery and price. As a general rule, obtain spares for critical equipment from Main Engine, Auxiliary Engine and high speed rotational equipment from the maker or maker representatives.

- The superintendents and the purchasing officer should always keep in mind that poor quality spares might damage equipment or reduce the time interval between overhauls. In addition, the cost of manpower used to repair or replace poor quality spare parts may far exceed the savings made at the time of purchase.

- Any spares supplied for critical equipment, Main Engine, Auxiliary Engine and high speed rotational equipment that requires class survey shall normally be purchased from the original supplier. Items purchased from other sources shall be accompanied with an appropriate certificate from one of the IACS members, e.g. main engine cylinder liners, boiler fittings and valves, spares for auxiliary engines, compressors and separators.

- Supply vessels with stores every 4 months, depending on practicality of the schedule. In between, vessels can issue requisitions for urgent requirements and emergency supplies. Both ship and office should endeavor to supply in the main ports to avoid excessive expenses related to transport and delivery.

- Do not exceed 25% of annual budget for an individual account code for 4 month stores requisitions and approvals. This gives us with 3 supplies 75% consumed and 25% left for in between deliveries for urgent and unexpected supplies.

- We can deviate from this rule in an economically convenient port like Rotterdam, Hamburg, Dubai or Singapore, but discuss and get approval from the technical director and again in his absence the senior technical superintendent.

- Only approved service companies to be used for any service on board. New companies and those which are not authorized by Makers have to be thoroughly assessed before approval following Approved Vendor procedure described in further sections. A detailed report for any service of machinery to be provided and signed by ship’s representative and attending company representative.

Note:	Any deviation from the above will require approval by the technical manager and in his absence the senior technical superintendent.

##### Purchasing Process/Quotation

###### Introduction

The superintendent shall carefully review the requisitions before passing them on to the purchasing officer for action.

In case of non budget requisition, corrective or defect , before placing the order, the technical department shall:

- Consult with the vessel

- Request further details

- Explanation or justification

The technical department will choose the most suitable suppliers based on but not limited to the following criteria:

- Location

- Contract purchase agreement

- Quality of goods

- Price of goods

- Delivery time

- Maker

- Vendors accreditation

If the value of the quote falls below the vendor’s minimum order value, thus incurring minimum order charges, the Purchaser or Technical Superintendent may inform the vessel that requisition is cancelled or rejected and guided further for local purchase or requested items to be included in another requisition.

All requisitions shall be processed through our PMS and shall be numbered sequentially.

C/E shall maintain ORL.

EXAMPLE:  XXXXX/V/XXXX/RQ/XXXX

    - XXXXX- vessel prefix

    - V – raised by vessel

    - O – raised by office

    - XXXX – requisition or PO number, which is sequential starting from 0001, from current year

    - RQ – Requisition

    - RFQ – Request For Quote

    - PO – Purchase Order

    - WRN – Warehouse Receipt Note

    - GRN – Good receipt Note

    - DO – Dispatch Order

    - INV – Invoice

    - XXXX – current year

Vessels may refer to PUR 07 to see how requisitions categories have been matched to various catalogues and spares in the PMS.

Assign priorities to raised requisitions as given below:

- Normal – this will be supplied either in conjunction with a regular storing or a convenient port, consolidated with other spares and stores. The Purchasing Officer endeavors to process an order for all normal spares orders within 1 week after approval from the technical superintendent. The store and services orders should be placed at least 1 week before port call, taking into consideration the product lead times and 3rd party involvement for service request.

- Urgent – this will apply to an order which should be supplied at the next convenient port, irrespective of scheduled storing intervals. The actual delivery time will be dependent on our suppliers but we will take measures to expedite delivery, considering the actual urgency of the case. The Purchasing Officer endeavors to place an order within 3 days after submission. In such cases the Office will consider incurring additional costs for freight and for supply in order to expedite the urgent order.

- Top Urgent – this will apply to an order that needs to be supplied immediately, either at the vessel’s current location or at least at the next port. In any case we need to use all possible means to get the order to the ship without delay. In case the order is not supplied straight away, then there may be significant risk to the vessel’s safe operation. The Purchasing Office endeavors to place an order 24 hours after submission subject to availability.

In case of a “Urgent” requisition:

- Communicate immediately with the responsible Technical Superintendent and Purchasing Officer.

- Do not add any non-urgent items to a top urgent order

In case of a “Top Urgent” requisition:

- Communicate immediately with the responsible Technical Superintendent and Operations Department.

- Do not add any non-urgent items to a top urgent order

      - Note:	This may result in delay.

- Copy all communication to the Technical Director in compliance with ships email reporting matrix (ADM 01)

- Complete a risk assessment and forward it to the office.

When drawing up a requisition for stores, vessels shall as far as possible follow the available catalogues in PMS. Use always the correct part/item number.

The purchasing officer shall update the vessel’s order database with relevant data and the status of the order.

The vessel can also use PMS Purchase Transaction.

###### Requisitions and Delivery

Update the order database and file a copy of each order in electronic format in the designated company share folder.

The technical superintendent or purchasing officer shall monitor the progress of the order from the supplier to the forwarder and to the ship. Order status reports and inventories from the forwarders should be frequently monitored and the order database updated accordingly.

Plan the delivery schedule for the next calendar year based on the previous year's deliveries. Use form PUR 08, share it with the vessel, and regularly update it.

Every vessel shall send an “Outstanding Orders - Summary Report” – PUR 01 by email once every month. This report will be checked and compared with the office database to confirm the status of all orders and ensure safe delivery on board.

The technical superintendent or purchasing officer may instruct ships to utilize specific forms for ordering equipment such as valves, motors, and gauges.

The technical superintendents and purchasing officers shall follow directives for obtaining authority before ordering goods over a certain value.

The technical department can provide details of the final order and final invoice to the vessel upon request.

A positive feedback system is in place, and vessels are encouraged to provide feedback on the quality of stores, spares, and provisions supplied.

Vessels should send accounts to office as follows:

Monthly

- Victualling

- Lubs

- Paints

- Chemicals

###### Emergency Purchase

- Safety and security of the crew

- Safety and security of the vessel

- Classification/statutory requirements

- Environmental protection

- Efficient operation of the vessel

The master may purchase necessary navigational charts and publications locally, prior to sailing, if unavailable from the normal supply resources.

If emergency purchases or services exceed 2000 USD, try to obtain authorization from the purchasing department.

If the safety, security, or operation of the vessel is adversely affected, proceed with the purchase or service request regardless of the cost. Invite competitive quotations from competent suppliers where possible.

Record emergency purchases placed directly by the vessel in the electronic purchasing system for reference. Indicate the supplier’s name and attach pertinent details/communication explaining the circumstances for the emergency purchase.

###### Local Purchases

The master shall obtain prior approval from the technical or purchasing department if items or services require to be purchased locally and are not of an emergency nature.

Vessels may purchases small quantity of stores and provisions, with limits up to 2000 USD per month. The reasons are :

- Reduce administration for the purchase of low-cost items

- Recognize that the Master may obtain better prices when purchasing provisions and stores using cash

- It is recommended to purchase items locally especially items content “DANGEROUS GOODS “, and restriction transport via air freight.

- Urgent spare / store items which immediately needed onboard

- Batteries

- Medicines

- Garbage disposal

When arranging landing of spare parts to the United States of America, ensure that the forwarder supplies relevant AMS information to Mid-Gulf Shipping Company () using form PUR 09.

###### Forwarding

Purchasing Officer shall follow below guidelines.

The company deals with a selected number of forwarders and port agents throughout the world at strategic locations based on:

- Their geographic position

- Storage capabilities

- Bonded warehouse facilities

- Service

- Tariff structure

Forwarding represents a significant portion of the ship’s operating costs. It is essential that the technical department forward spares and stores to the vessel in the most economical and efficient way and supplied together with 4 months supplies.

Avoid ad hoc forwarding of spares at each port of call unless the spares are top-urgent. In general, use sea freight or consolidated road haulage to forward heavy non-urgent spare parts, when possible.

Send time-critical spare parts by air freight using the most economical routes and consolidating, as much as possible. The technical department shall take note that early notice of forwarding requirements enables the forwarder to find the most economical shipment option.

In general, all spares and stores received from the suppliers are consolidated at the forwarders. Once this is done the technical department will instruct the forwarders to make the shipments either direct to the vessels, dispatch them to the vessel’s agents or to other forwarders/agents closer to the vessel’s ports of call for further consolidation.

On receipt of the consignment on board, the vessel shall send notification on “Received Items” to the purchasing department. Check the items carefully and update the database accordingly.

The technical department shall follow up incorrect, wrongly delivered or missing items. Such items will be treated as pending until the problem is resolved. The technical department shall ensure that the database includes a note to withhold payment of the supplier’s/forwarder’s invoice until the matter is resolved. Office to instruct vessel to complete office form PUR 06 for all deliveries, this form is sent with the delivery notice.

The technical department shall advise the vessel whether the disputed item(s) will be cancelled, re-supplied or re-ordered under a new requisition number.

##### Guidelines on Ship Operating Costs and Budgets

###### Introduction

The budget itemizes and forecasts the expected costs and expenditures associated with fleet operations, maintenance, crewing, insurance, and technical aspects within a specified period.

It is a tool to allocate funds efficiently, monitor and control expenses, and ensure the financial sustainability of individual vessels and the company overall.

###### Principles of Budgets

Budgets are based on:

- PMS, condition, and original spare parts for Main Engine, Aux Engine, and High-Speed rotational equipment following our IMS.

- Inventory on board.

- Critical spare parts as defined by crew and TSI, not to be used for routine maintenance.

- Specific needs/jobs based on vessel conditions outside of PMS, e.g., known defects planned based on condition.

- Agreed contracts with service companies, i.e., Safety Equipment, Navigation Equipment & IT equipment, Lub Oil, and Chemicals.

- Transport costs based on vessel trading area.

- International requirements and regulations, oil major requirements, and Class requirements.

- Improving efficiency of the vessel, e.g., fuel consumption, lights, CII, EEXI.

###### Guidelines on Budget Construction

The vessels will be asked to contribute to the creation of the annual budget using the TECH 25 Budget Template.

Considerations include:

Trading pattern and steaming days of the vessel.

Recommended lub oil consumption rates and operating experience.

Requirements for overhaul and repair of machinery during the year, based on PMS.

Capital improvements and supply of new equipment such as ECDIS, radar, high-pressure washing equipment.

Upgrading and repair projects requiring extra materials and manpower.

Compliance with new regulations during the year.

Drydocking periods during the year.

Number of Main Engine and Auxiliary Engine Unit overhauls planned.

Major repairs for Main Engine and Auxiliary Engine Turbochargers.

Major repairs of steam, hydraulic, electrical/automation, cooling water, fuel, lube oil, and compressed air systems.

Major repairs on cargo handling equipment and spares needed for the next year like cargo pumps, level gauging system, inert gas, etc.

Major repairs of navigational equipment, like radar replacement, gyro-sphere renewals, etc.

Safety items needing replacement due to expiration date/condition, including life jackets, life vests, life vest lights, etc.

Ropes, wires, tails, ladders due for replacement in the next year due to time in use or condition.

Attendance of service engineers for VDR, on-load gears for life/rescue boat control systems.

Expenditure for the upgrade/maintenance of machinery, living areas, messrooms, cabins, etc.

Consider critical spare parts list and inventory on board.

The technical superintendent will ask the vessels to nominate a “Budget Team” once TECH 25 has been submitted, this team can be comprised of indivdulas whom the technical superintendent can rely on and use during the budgeting process.

The Budget Team contributes to the thought process and sanity checks of the submitted budget proposals.

###### Guidelines on Operating Costs and Reporting

Once the vessel budget is approved, it will be communicated with the vessel. Any requisition not part of the approved budget should be clearly justified and communicated to the technical superintendent.

Four-month stores requisitions and approvals shall not exceed 25% of the annual budget for an individual account code, allowing three supplies with 75% consumed and 25% left for in-between deliveries for urgent and unexpected supplies.

Every quarter, the vessel variance report will be shared for better overview planning.

###### Guarantee Claims

Defective items are to be retained on board, appropriately marked with the guarantee claim number, and returned to the builder or maker if requested.

Complete the guarantee claim report and send it to the technical department for all defects or omissions found. Omissions shall be checked against the building specification.

Note: Number all guarantee claims sequentially starting from 0001, e.g., Hull Number – CLM - 001.

Maintain a summary of guarantee claims/status onboard and update the technical superintendent every month via email attachment. Issue a requisition order for a guarantee claim if requested by the technical superintendent.

Note: The requisition should state that it is related to the relevant guarantee claim number and follow regular purchasing procedures. Use the technical category for guarantee claims.

### 10.5.4 Provision Account - rev 0 issued 13.12.2024

##### Provision Account

###### Introduction

At the end of the month, the master of each vessel shall produce a provision account using form ACCT 05.

###### Vessel Provision Account / Report

Check the following figures before passing the report to the technical department:

- Amount brought forward from the previous month (same as the stock at the end of the last month)

- Amounts of provision supplied during the month, including:

- Provisions purchased locally by the vessel

- Provisions supplied as per office purchase order or by contractor

Verify against purchase order data:

- Quantities

- Prices

- Discounts applied

- Deduct expired food, if any

- Feeding rate

- Check calculation based on the formula:

- Provision consumed during the month divided by total man-days

Note: Man-days represent the total number of food portions served during each period of time; exclude night meals.

###### Checking and Filing of Provision Accounts

Prepare the provision account for all vessels in USD. Include the following in each provision account:

- ACCT - 05C Victualling Rate Calculation

- Invoices/vouchers for provisions purchased

- ACCT - 05D Representation Expenses

- ACCT – 05A List of stocks remaining on board (with March, June, September, and December accounts)

First, check the monthly consumption figure, including the supply order. This is the value of stocks on board at the beginning of the month plus purchases during the month minus the total value of the stocks remaining at the end of the current month.

Divide the consumption by the number of rations consumed during the month to give the feeding rate per man per day.

One ration equals breakfast, lunch, and dinner. For representation meals, one ration equals any three meals. If not divided by three, then a portion of a ration is counted. The number of rations should include those served to passengers, wives, visitors, officials, etc.

Send the provision account to the technical department monthly.

After checking the provision account, the purchasing officer in charge will provide the data to the accounting department.

If the monthly feeding rate on a particular vessel has exceeded the stipulated amount, the office may ask the master to provide an explanation.
